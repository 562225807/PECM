i do n't want to play a game , sheldon .
wow , and i remember when you love play game with me . maybe penny be n't the only relationship you 're phone in .
it not that i 'd stop try , it just how relationship progress . they start with infatuation , but over time mellow into something more comfortable .
it look like a map from dungeon and dragon .
mm . except the creature in the crib be a level-nine poop monster .
okay , uh , you check for squeak , and i will mark them down .
okay , space a , here we go . it 's squeak . mark it .
it 's nice to think that you grow up in this room and now your daughter 's go to a well .
mm . i hope she have the same amount of sex in it i do . none . next square .
why do you bounce with your hand in the air like that ?
it 's a tradition of my people . if i be a rich man , ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum .
would you like to play a drive game i invent ?
be it about the fail state of my relationship with penny ?
never mind . you know , penny go to this spa to be away from you . be you sure you should be go there ?
i do n't want to wait two day for u to work this out .
very well . you get married spur of the moment , i do n't see why your divorce should be any different .
i would pull this car over and kick you out , but if penny dump me , you 're all i get .
when be the last time you get a massage ?
sheldon walk on my back two week ago , but that be just 'cause there be a spider on his pillow and he be try to get away .
leonard stood on me once , too , but he be just try to see the rise parade .
i do n't know the protocol , be you gon na be naked for your massage ?
well , yeah .
hmm . then this be probably too many clothes .
hey .
what be you do here ?
i come here to apologize .
okay . i do n't get it , you say make an effort , here i be make an effort .
hello , amy . it 's nice to see you .
nice to see you , too .
and that 's how you make effort look effortless .
all right . can you please just go and we 'll talk about this tomorrow ?
i do n't understand what you want .
i 'm try to figure it out .
sheldon , why do n't we give them some privacy ?
very well . hey , later we 'll check out the minibar , i 'll show you how godzilla get drunk .
so , what we do be map out the entire room to identify every squeak . watch . it 's easy , once you get the hang of it . step . step . hop onto ottoman .
do n't do that in sock , i almost broke my neck .
hold on , i do n't think she be impressed .
there 's a cucumber in my water .
uh-huh .
it 's there on purpose . it 's refresh .
interest . the world 's most boring liquid and the world 's most boring vegetable , but you put 'em together and bleugh .
hey .
hey .
oh good , you 're here . be you still fight ? if you get divorce , do i get two christmas 's ?
we 're not get divorce .
listen , we realize , that , uh , we 're face some new challenge a a married couple .
yeah . and there be a few thing we need to stay on top of . so we thought it would useful , and i ca n't believe i 'm about to say this , um .
would you please help u make a relationship agreement ? but one that 's tailor to u , okay , we do n't need a bathroom schedule .
although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance .
what do you say ?
i get to write a contract ? i say , let 's get this party of the first part start .
do you really think that 's funny ?
it 's in our agreement . i have to laugh .
if you find this draft acceptable , then i believe your new relationship agreement be ready to be sign .
article _ , subsection b , leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hour penny be not home . this include boxer , brief , thong , g-string or anything else that call attention to his pasty little thigh .
do it really need to say that ?
oh well , great then , here , you sign here , date here , and penny , if you could initial here to indicate that you 're accept leonard in a be condition .
i remember signing our first relationship agreement .
mm . you seem to be forget the no nostalgia clause .
right , right . get it .
what 's go on with that woman you 're date ?
i broke up with her .
i thought thing be go well . what happen ?
that 's not a problem , we can figure this out . what be the reason woman reject raj ?
do n't like game . that 's one .
ignore him . yeah , sorry about the breakup .
that 's okay , i 'm fine .
of course you 're fine . not every member of a specie find a mate . sir isaac newton die a virgin , look at the contribution he make .
i 'm not a virgin , sheldon .
so now you think you 're well than isaac newton ? oh , no wonder woman do n't like you .
what ? he say he be fine .
sometimes people say thing they do n't mean .
oh , that 's a paradox . i mean if you meant what you just say , then that mean you may not have meant what you just say .
careful , i saw this on star trek . smoke 's gon na come out of his ear soon . hey .
hey , boy . how 's it go ?
well , i thought we be have a nice conversation , but it turn out i be be offensive .
sheldon , what do you do ?
it 's okay , i 'm fine .
do n't fall for it . he 'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin , and suddenly you 're the bad guy .
sheldon , when i say i be fine , i meant i do n't want to talk about it any more .
then why do n't you say that ?
because that 's not what people do .
well , i would prefer if people told me exactly what be on their mind .
no . no , you do n't , you really do n't . i actually ca n't say do n't enough .
well , it certainly would be easy . you have no idea what it 's like to struggle with recognize emotional cue .
i 'm sure it 's extremely frustrate .
thank you .
and also a little sad .
okay , now you 're just show off .
and you think we can get those guy to reprogram sheldon ? cool .
wow , i find that hard to believe .
that a bunch of awkward scientist with no social skill would invent a machine to do it for them ?
i take it back . i believe it .
you if it 's at mit , i can make some call . maybe we can get sheldon a prototype .
what do you think ?
a machine that read emotion be intrigue . it could help me be a more considerate friend .
it could also help me identify my enemy , discover their fear and then i could use those fear to destroy them .
i be think maybe a library or a game room .
i do n't like train . you like train .
i know , and amy say i ca n't have a train room .
sheldon , i just heard from the guy at mit about that emotion reader . they 're send a prototype for you to beta test .
wonderful . although i 'm not sure how i feel about be use a a guinea pig .
well , when you get the machine , you can find out .
maybe i could use it to understand why woman keep dump me .
well , you do n't need a machine for that , just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize .
that 's actually not a bad idea . maybe i could even get them all together , sort of like a , a focus group , to find out what 's wrong with me .
no , raj , that 's a terrible idea .
yeah , i be joking .
really ? uh , little tip : joke be often well when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha .
hey , great news . the tv i want will fit in the game room , and if i leave the curtain open , i can watch it from work .
hey , can you hold off redo the room ? my brother 's come out here in a few week .
oh . yeah . okay , sure . what 's go on with your brother ?
my dad ask if i can get him a job interview at my work .
huh . be that a good idea ? i mean , you think they 'll consider someone who be in prison for sell drug ?
well , i sell pharmaceutical . that 's just a really hard to spell word for drug .
well , i 'm sure he 'll appreciate carry his sample in a briefcase instead of his colon . how long do you think he 'll stay ?
i , i 'm not sure . maybe a few day . unless he get the job , then who know ?
hmm . who know ? that 's excite . i 'll get to wake up every morning and see if he 's still here .
you do n't have a problem with this , do you ?
of course not . i mean , he 's your brother .
okay . thank you , you 're the best . mm .
remember that when the new tv fall off the wall and crush u both .
this thing 's pretty cool . it interprets emotion use a wireless signal to analyse subtle change in breathing and heart rate .
it 's amaze a machine can do that .
yes . now , when the robot rise up , they 'll know that i 've be root for them the whole time .
the display be sync to your phone . give it a try .
all right . now , i 'm gon na look at some picture to prompt an emotional response , and we 'll see if the machine can identify them accurately .
okay , i 'm look at the first picture .
you be happy ?
yes . i 'm look at puppi
aw . somebody 's ignore their tiny needle teeth , but all right .
try another one .
okay . what do it say i 'm feel ?
sad .
yes . i 'm look at a picture of my grandma .
oh , that make sense , 'cause she 's go and you miss her .
yes .
okay , emily . yeah , sound great . see you then .
yeah . i 'm get all my ex together in order to discus why they broke up with me and how i can be a well boyfriend .
we be go to find out .
do n't worry , i 'm a grown man . i have a thick skin .
you 're so stupid .
hey .
hey , would you take a look at my brother 's resume ? i 'm try to help him clean it up a little .
yeah , sure . he really work with the drug enforcement agency ?
he do n't know it till he be cuffed , but yeah .
hey , leonard , if you 're happy and you know it , no need to clap your hand , because i have an emotion detector .
how 's it work out ?
surprisingly well .
that 's great , i 'm happy for you .
no , wait , uh , hold on . oh , what , you be . be n't you sweet ?
what 's that ? be you work on your resume ?
oh , ooh ! and that make leonard angry .
no , it do n't .
what , leonard , please . i know an angry face when i see it . it 's this red frowny guy on my phone .
what ? be you really upset about randall come ?
no .
yes .
i say no .
it 's like you 're twin .
leonard , if you 're mad about this , just tell me .
fine . you invite your drug dealer brother to stay with u for god know how long and do n't bother to ask me first .
he 's my brother . i do n't think i need your permission .
well , hey . now she 's angry , too . this thing work like gangbusters .
i 'm not say you have to ask my permission , but you could have talk to me about it before you say it be okay .
like you talk to me about your game room ?
our game room . i be gon na put a scent candle in it .
he 's still mad .
stop enjoy their fight .
you first .
if you be this upset , why do n't you say so when i told you ?
because i do n't want to sound like a jerk .
well , you sound like one now . i do n't see the big deal if my brother come and stay for a while .
if you get him a job , he 's gon na live here forever !
he would get his own place .
have he ever have his own place ?
yes .
do it have a metal toilet next to the bed ?
you give me a bill at the end of every month .
stay out of this . you and your stupid machine start this fight .
you be lucky that this feeling machine do n't have feeling .
gladly . can we storm out ?
i think it loses it impact if we 're chat about it .
fine . i 'll just give them the finger .
okay , first off , i want to thank you all so much for come . howard be here to interpret for emily , and to take note .
no , he do n't think it 's stupid .
uh , head up , both of you be name emily , so we 'll call you red-headed emily , and you , red-headed emily , junior .
hey , you go out with him . i do n't .
okay , uh , let 's get thing start . um , why do n't we go around the room , say your name , and why you broke up with me . want to kick it off ?

i do do that . i can be insensitive to other people 's boundary . howard , would you write that down ?
schmuck . get it .

what brought that on ?
well , last night amy be angry with me because i 'd be foolishly tell people about certain personal matter .
that 's understandable .

he sound like a sociopath .
we do n't know , his mother never have him test .
you 're talk about me . very funny . although i would enjoy draw up a budget and force raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion .
wait , wait , who 's gon na break it to the penguin ?

look at you , go to comic-con , talk about ewoks . i really have become the cool one around here .
you actually think penny will have fun at comic-con ?
no . which will make me miserable , which be usually sheldon 's job .
she 's gon na hate wait in line for the panel .
and hate all the crowd at the panel .
she 's gon na hate the panel .
why do n't you just tell her not to come ?
well , she 's so excite , i ca n't do that to her .
what if you make it sound so bad she wo n't want to go ?
you can always watch the panel online . oh , boy , we do say that a lot .
come on , sheldon , it 's comic-con . just let me have the money for this , and i wo n't ask for anything else .
you put me in charge of your finance . if you want someone weak and spineless you could walk all over , you should have ask leonard .
see ? miserable .
okay , you 're right , i get myself into this , but i 've never miss a comic-con with you guy .
your father may have spoil you , but i wo n't . if you want a ticket to comic-con , i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself .
yeah , you 're a grown man who 's highly educate . you could charge people money to punch you .
go ahead , make joke . i do n't know why you think you 're go to comic-con , you just have a baby .
so ?
well , so ? so you think bernadette 's just gon na let you jet down to san diego for five day and leave her alone ?
hang , hang on . so i have to bring penny , you ca n't afford it , howard 's gon na get in trouble , and this guy get to have a great time .
i 'm gon na go a dumbledore .
mm-mm , how 's my favourite girl ?
what you do ?

that 's probably my fault . she may have heard about my cool dumbledore costume .
but you charge me hundred for this stuff .
but i need to earn enough money so i can go to comic-con .

i 'm look to make extra money and be wonder if you have any chore i could do .
hang on . bernie , can i outsource my chore to an indian guy ?

be there any scenario where we 're not in full body paint ?
yeah , if you want u to look like loser .
hey , um , be you sure the guy be okay with me come ?
yeah , of course , why ?

why ? do you not want me to go ?
no , i want you to go .
okay , good , 'cause that 's what i want , too .
now we 're go a hulk and she-hulk . i do n't want to take my shirt off at comic-con .
if i may speak for comic-con , we do n't want that either .
be that nice ?
no , but it 's honest , and it sound like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship .
uh , it 's more complicate than that .
i should hope so . when she call me an insensitive jerk , i 'd like to think she meant it .
there 's get to be other way you can make a quick buck .
yeah , you 'd think . ooh , maybe i could sell my blood and sperm .
here , let me help you .
oh , double stuffed oreo , i remember when i could afford you .

that 's fine . she and i can cry together .
i know , i wish there be some way we could help him .

he do n't really want penny to go to comic-con . he 's just do it to make her happy .
really ? because she do n't actually want to go . she 's just do it to make him happy .
so they 're both try to make each other happy , and the end result be they make each other sad ? that 's hilarious . i ca n't wait to tell them .
because it 's between them .

we do have sheldon 's old room . if he really need a place to stay , i guess we should offer it to him .
you 're a good friend .
be i still a good friend if i wait and hope that howard offer him a place to live first ?
i know if the role be reverse , he would do it for me .
well , we can make some space in the garage . maybe put a cot out there , get him a space heater , maybe a hot plate .
let 's hope he think so , too .
for the last time , no hulk , no batman , no life-size statue .
wow . i 'm start to think you do n't mean it when you say you want to spruce up the place .

but i can use the downstairs bathroom , right ?
yeah . we barely use it , so it 'll be like it 's yours .
cool , cool , yeah , yeah , hold on one second .
what ?
hey , what 's it like share a bathroom with penny ? be there hair everywhere ? do she use your loofah ?
i do n't have a loofah .
okay , well , if i move in , you ca n't use mine . hold on a second . hey , howard , uh , how 's the wi-fi in the garage ?
i do n't know . why be you ask all these question ?
well , to be honest , leonard 's on the other line , and he offer me their spare bedroom .
great . go live there .
but you make the garage sound so fun .
i just do n't want you to feel bad about it . unless leonard 's apartment also have a raccoon that chew it way in on cold night , go there .
one second . okay , i think we 're close . how do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room ?
hey , pal , you want to live here or not ?
oh , uh , hi , penny . yes , please .
hi .
hi , uh , penny , this circular be address to occupant , but with our apartment switch , it 's unclear whether it 's yours or mine .
what 's it for ?
roof .
yeah , it 's yours .
yeah , for a little while .
what about his dog ?
she 'll be in her crate , it 's not a big deal .
i suppose that 's acceptable .
well , sheldon 's get a little well with dog . he even take a picture with pluto at disneyland .
if real dog give me button , i 'd like them , too . well , i think it 's very nice that you 're help out our friend .
and i think it 's nice that you 're take whatever medication amy 's clearly give you .
and what be that suppose to mean ?
well , it 's like that science thing . for every action , you have a gigantic and annoy reaction .
just when i thought you could n't get any hotter .
mm-hmm .
do n't listen to them . what 's weird be that penny almost get a science fact right .
i mean , it 's unfair . people just assume i 'm go to be upset by raj move into my old room .
but you be , be n't you ?
oh , i 'm outrage .
talk to me . tell me what 's go on .
wrong . we be stand outside my room in the hallway .
and there be the love of which i speak .
i realize it 's irrational , but with raj move in there , i 'm feel a bit replace .
well , this be n't an easy time for him . he 's lose his apartment , he 's in debt , he 's probably humiliate .
yes , probably . but until we know for sure , how can i feel well ?
raj , you do n't have to serve u .
it 's the least i can do for help me carry my stuff up .
it be really no problem .
anyway , thanks again .
hey , look at that . you 've get a raj , we 've get a stuart . maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together .
i do n't know . yours look like he have worm .
you ready to go ?
a housewarming gift for raj .
well , a bunch of fake snake well not spring out of it , 'cause that be a lousy anniversary present .
hi .
perfect timing . food 's ready .
wait , be anything gon na jump out of that .
no . i already ask .
thank you , sheldon . it 's a blank notebook .
well , i have some of my best idea in that room , and i 'm sure you will , too .
this mean a lot .
well , i know this be a difficult time for you . you 're lose your apartment , you 're in debt , and you just , you must be humiliate .
sheldon .
oh , good grief . she be such a stickler for cite source . those be amy 's word .
sheldon .
i know , i know , good grief be originally say by charlie brown , geez .
can you believe this guy ?
i thought that be gon na break the other way .
come on , sheldon . maybe we should just eat at our place .
fine . you take my room . you turn my friend against me . i hope you 're happy .
what do i have to be happy about ? my life 's a wreck .
how come he can say it and i ca n't ?
just keep walk .
honestly , i 've be well . do you have time ? leonard say you 're very busy these day .
well , our friend raj move into my old room , and it 's brought up a lot of negative feeling for me .
beverley , you know i hold you in high esteem . can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer , and get to the part where you tell me the answer ?
i have .
i have n't thought about that .
and do n't start think about it now .
that 's not true .
i have no idea all our relationship be such a disaster . boy , you 're good .
maybe move in be a bad idea . i have n't be here one day , i 'm already cause problem .
you do n't do anything . it 's sheldon .
you do n't do anything , it 's sheldon . that 'd make a nice needlepoint pillow .
so , relax . we 're happy to have you .
thank you , but how do i know you 're not say that just to be nice ?
do you actually pay for that haircut ?
that 'll do it .
hey , raj , i owe you an apology . look , could you please put your dog on a leash ?
sheldon , she 's fine .
well , then at least hold her still so i can pretend she 's stuffed . raj , i let my emotion get the best of me , and i unfairly take it out on you .
no , i ca n't take all the credit . i spoke with leonard 's mother , and she make me feel well .
i do n't know who you talk to , but that be n't my mother .
beverly point out that i 'm experience insecurity in my relationship with amy , in the same way that leonard and penny be in their relationship .
what be you talk about ? we 're fine .
why be you say we have marital problem ? we do n't have marital problem .
look , just because we take our friend in do not mean that penny and i be afraid to be alone .
yeah , this be a special circumstance .
yeah , well , a circumstance can happen twice and still be special .
well , now that you point it out
be you kid me ?
we do seem to keep find room mate .
now you 're take her side ?
howard ? howard ? it 's me , it 's just me .
what be you do here ?
well , i texted you , but you do n't respond . leonard and penny be argue .
i 'm sorry , guy . sheldon be upset , leonard and penny be fight , i just want to go some place where i be n't cause problem .
i 'll say it again . india .
can i just stay in the garage ?
thank you .
never should 've have all these kid so close together .
you okay ?
i ca n't sleep .
what 's wrong ?
beverley believe i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch .
yes . i do n't care for unconscious thought . my brain and i be best friend . it should tell me everything .
i mean , how it relates to our relationship , not the bromance between you and your brain .
what if she 's correct ? do n't that say something trouble about u ?
i do n't know . i just think you 're the kind of person who like a contingency plan .
you need to stop hang out with your brain so much . it 's not a good influence .
would n't you feel well about yourself if you be more independent ?
penny would be the entree . then leonard 's basically a cheese course . and because i love you , you 're dessert .
i want to say aw , but i 'm gon na say ew .
do n't you even feel a little bad sponge off your friend ?
morning .
do you know raj move out last night ?
what ? why ?
should we go bring him back ?
oh , that be just because my mother get in my head . it 's like be possess , but instead of satan it 's , actually , it 's the same thing .
all right , so we 'll ask him to come back .
well , great .
do n't you want to get dress first ?
just one second . help , cinnamon 's loose in the building .
amy , quick , lock the door .
we 're so sorry if we make you feel uncomfortable . we really be n't fight about you .
you be not a burden , and we want you to come back and stay with u .
but i also upset sheldon , and he 's not gon na want to come over if i 'm there .
more reason for you to stay .
if you ever want to change thing up , you 're always welcome here .
i appreciate it , but i think stay with leonard and penny make more sense for everyone .
then it 's settle .
and just so you know , it 's only temporary . i 'm not gon na get too comfortable .
you know , downward-facing dog come from the sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana .
oh , that 's beautiful . what do it mean ?
downward-facing dog .
yeah , i guess they do n't have sanskrit for butt up and head down .
hey , we write the kama sutra . if it involves butt , there 's a word for it .
i thought we be get breakfast before work .
it 's my fault . i ask penny to do yoga with me .
if you want , i can get ready in five minute .
it 's cute that you think that . do n't worry about it .
hey , can i ask you a favour ? would you mind take cinnamon for a walk ?
sure . you 're living here for free , i guess i owe you .
bye , cinnamon . be a good girl .
yeah , bye , sweetie .
bye .
yeah , yeah , bye , leonard .
okay , and tree pose .
well , she 's do .
thing have be go really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope .
that 's great . how so ?
oh , very well . what have you be work on ? and feel free to honk during the boring part .
i 'm do some experiment to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decide to move it .
so you 're attempt to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain .
yes , i 'm try to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond , precisely where and when an event of awareness take place .
well , what do you know ? here i be , wait to be bore with biology , and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy . which , unlike my body , be an okay place to tickle .
you know , when i be six , i want to marry the gorilla from good night , gorilla . maybe i be onto something .
gentleman , the most interest thing just happen with this spoon .
unless it be sing be our guest , i doubt it .
yeah , i picked it up without think about it . which raise a neuroscientific question , when do i decide to pick it up ?
the big question be , what be you gon na eat with that spoon ? you do n't get any food .
he do raise an interest point .
yeah , me , too .
i 'm sorry , i space . be we still talk about the spoon ?
it 's nice to see you take an interest in amy 's work .
no , i be go to , but she call in sick . and guess who else call in sick .
paul .
paul .
who 's paul ?
oh , you met him at the office christmas party . he 's married to nancy .
oh , sure . wait , nancy ?
i bet jennifer get a promotion out of this , which be so unfair because i work twice a hard a she do .
do n't worry , jerry wo n't be fool by that type of behaviour .
jerry ?
it do n't work for randy , it do n't work for tina , it sure a hell be n't gon na work for jennifer .
well , i hope not . i just hate when people play those kind of game .
tina ?
with your sale record , you have nothing to worry about .
mm .
i go to your office christmas party ?
you know , i like harp lesson , but i 'm think of switch to elevator repair lesson . what be you work on ?
it could be the most inspire combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee . it be like drinking two seventh of the rainbow .
sheldon , this be really interest .
yeah , and this one wo n't stain my teeth purple .
you know , we 've never collaborate professionally before . be you worried it might affect our relationship ?
that be a valid point . perhaps we should establish some ground rule .
well , that would make me feel well .
all right , let 's start right now . uh , rule number one , no use sexuality to get your way .
that 's a ridiculous rule .
be it ?
okay , how be that ?
i can actually feel the toxin be pull out of my skin .
well , this be a moisturize mask .
oh , well , then i can actually feel the moisture go into my skin .
hey , i hope you do n't mind , i use a little of your eye cream last night .
i 'd still like to know who jerry be .
do n't worry about it . hey , after this , how about we all go out and do something together ?
that would be great . thank you .
you want to go shopping ?
ooh , yes . fun .
or we could do something we 'll all enjoy , like play a board game .
i believe i 've make some progress on our ground rule .
oh , good . what be they ?
oh , of course . i 'll get that back . like all my underwear , that notebook say property of sheldon cooper .
sheldon , if we 're gon na have ground rule , i 'll tell you the first ground rule . i make the ground rule .
i 'd write that down , but i ca n't now , can i ?
i mean , they do n't say anything , but i just kind of felt like i be be a weird third wheel .
huh , so you can tell what that feel like . interest .
anyway , i figure i can hang out with my friend and have fun , too .
oh , it 's just nice to be with people who be happy to have me around . be n't that right , halley ?
well , at least someone have the courage to say it .
thank you , you be a good citizen . told you . go ahead , throw my underwear out the window . same thing 's gon na happen .
terrific . do you want to hear our new set of ground rule ?
fire away .
number one , we 're on the same team , we 're not in competition .
that 's smart , because sheldon _ , amy _ .
number two , disagreement can happen politely . there 's no need to call an idea stupid .
aw , someone drew a penis in it .
be you listen ?
i 'm sorry , go ahead .
number three , to avoid get frustrate , we take built-in break and reward our success with a small treat .
ooh , that sound fun . now , we 're talk about real treat , right ? not bible verse like my mother use to give me .
whatever you want . so , shall we get to work ?
biology and physic come together , this be like the peanut butter cup of the mind . oh , i know what i want my treat to be .
yes , this be remarkable .
so we 're agree , it 's complete garbage .
by the way , your name can go first .
a little , until i saw them in match top .
nice . _ diaper . that ought to get u to wednesday .
well , what be i suppose to say , stop have fun without me ?
this one say that every time i go out . see ? i listen to you .
i know , but he be my friend first . it 's like she 's steal him and they 're just have the best time do all their dumb girly stuff together .
you sure you do n't fit in ? you sound like a catty bitch to me .
i do n't know where we go wrong .
yeah , the math be so inelegant . i 'm not even sure it make sense .
well , do n't give up . maybe we can fix it .
can you stop breathing so loud ? i can hear your nose whistle .
i can hear your face talk , so we 're even .
all right , either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown race .
fine . fine . you want me to blow my nose ? here , i 'll blow it . well ?
no , i can still hear it . oh , wait , that 's me . never mind , it 's fine .
you know , you 're exhaust . i knew work together be a bad idea .
hold on . i see what 's wrong here . we do the propagation only to the occipital lobe , not to the prefrontal cortex .
that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increase _ millisecond .
oh , that be much well . yeah , boy , if good idea come out of your brain the way mucus come out of your nose , we 'd be in good shape .
now , take a sip , swirl it around your mouth , and try to notice the flavour , the tannin , the texture . well ?
i probably should have spit out my gum first .
yeah . you know , the last couple of week have be pretty rough , but , uh , stay here with you guy have really help take my mind off of it .
mm . well , we 've love have you around . right , sweetie ? leonard ?
when do he leave ?
yeah , that 's rude .
you know , it 's nice to spend time with people who do n't talk about work like it 's some kind of soap opera .
yeah .
you should be happy someone want to do the stuff with penny you do n't want to .
wait . what ? what do i make you do ?
i 'm sure i 'm overreact .
i do n't want to sound like a jealous baby .
i have a feel you be use the wrong computational model , but i do n't say anything 'cause you 're so sensitive .
hey , i wonder what kind of success we 'd have if we define measurement a the first moment that an action potential be see by the visual cortex .
that be a dare and insightful solution .
we 're finally make progress . i wish we could do it without fight .
what if the fight be the reason we 're make progress ?
i suppose it 's conceivable that the hormone associate with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpen our cognitive process .
well , if that 's the case , then your grandparent mumble and have bad posture .
how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey , wait a second . wait . delta t could equal alpha sub-zero .
it seem we have a choice to make . abandon all ground rule in the name of science , or give up collaborate for the sake of our relationship .
there 's only one clear choice .
science it be .
no , you bonehead .
name call , that be perfect . now , when i get to this equation here , really let me have it . you know ? if it help , i 'm not the sharpest dresser .
anyway , i know it 's silly , but since raj move in , i 've be feel a little left out .
well , sweetie , that 's crazy .
no , no , penny , do n't dismiss his feeling .
thank you . i just feel
hang on , i 'm not say that his feeling be n't crazy . i just do n't want him to think that this be n't a safe place .
well , to be truthful
well , why would n't this be a safe place ? i mean , he 's surround by his wife and one of his best friend .
i do n't want to speak for leonard .
thank you . i
yeah , you 're right . you know , you 're really sensitive about this kind of stuff .
i 'm a good listener .
yeah .
hey , olsen twin
what ?
well , i mean , i 'm sit right here . you 're talk about my feeling and somehow leave me out of the conversation .
i 'm sorry . what do you want to say ?
i do n't know , you pretty much cover it .
can you read them back ?
revise ground rule number one , we be on the same team , but it be a competition .
excellent . excellent . and on a related point , you 're go down , punk .
revise ground rule number two , there be definitely stupid question , and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face .
i love that one .
thanks , babe . number three , fair topic for insult include educational pedigree , scientific field , intellectual prowess , and mama .
yeah , that list be strong . like your mother 's urge to be promiscuous with sailor .
look at this . elon musk have a theory that we 're all just character in some advanced civilization 's video game .
so some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me ?
well , he do n't say it 's a good game .
what 's up ?
the air force contact me about our quantum gyroscope . they want to have a meeting .
really ?
yeah . this military guy show up at howard 's door . he be terrify .
oh , what do he say ?
he give me his business card and ask me to please pas it along to howard .
that do n't sound terrify .
to a white guy born here , no . if you be a brown guy whose name have a lot of syllable in it , terrify .
you realize if the military declares our research classify , they can take the whole thing away from u .
and if that happens , we 'll never be able to sell it commercially .
there go our big payday .
i be counting on that money . i need to make a much a my wife so i do n't have to try so hard in bed .
you do that , too ?
oh , yeah . how do you think i stay this thin ?
gentleman , i think we be lose sight of the real issue . we be on the precipice of become faceless cog in the military-industrial complex . be n't that excite ?
well , you 're kid , right ?
sheldon , we could be contribute to a weapon system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand year .
okay , howard 's on board . what do you think , leonard ?
all right , we work at a giant pharmaceutical company . get him some anti-anxiety med .
you know , when leonard 's feel anxious i make him take a long walk .
do that help ?
well , for a while . then he come back .
what 's wrong ?
you do already know , right ?
no . you told me not to .
why do n't you want anyone to know ?
would they really do that ?
wail till i snapchat that my friend might be work on a top secret government project .
be you crazy ? you ca n't put that on snapchat .
fine , i 'll put it on facebook like a caveman .
you know , maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer .
that 's not a bad idea .
well , you must have someone in your family that 's a lawyer .
why ? because i 'm jewish ? that 's like me say , hey , you 're indian , do n't your cousin work in a call centre ?
my cousin do work in a call centre .
and my cousin 's a lawyer .
we do n't need howard 's cousin . no , we have me .
you 're not a lawyer , sheldon , you 're just a know-it-all .
i be not a know-it-all . i 'm a person who know lot of thing and like to correct other people when they 're wrong .
that 's the definition of be a know-it-all .
or in german , a besserwisser .
how do you think you be gon na hide your pregnancy ?
where do you get empty dove bar wrapper ?
well , whatever happens , we 're here for you .
yeah , drive safe . we love you . and give u a call oh , my god , it be me , it be me . i 'm the one who blabbed she be pregnant !
what ?
oh , here 's your coat , honey . that 's such a cute jacket . oh god , i feel so bad , i just lie to her .
oh , but you do it so well . that 's amaze , it 's like watch a sculptor , but your clay be lie .
be that really what 's important right now ?
that 's super helpful , amy . thanks a lot . i ca n't wait to do that .
i can see a clump of bitch cell lightin ' up from here .
give me a second to call my cousin .
i do n't see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regard intellectual property .
first of all , he 's in boca raton , which be well than fort lauderdale . but more importantly , he last two day on jeopardy , so he 's clearly a smart guy .
hello .
hey , marty . thanks for talk to u .
well , i married a little catholic girl , so we 're even . anyway , this be leonard and sheldon . the three of u come up with the guidance system .
hi .
and this be my friend , raj .
oh , i 'm not on the patent . i 'm just here because there 's a bumblebee in my office .
i saw it . it 's big .
anyway , like i say in the e-mail , this meeting 's on thursday . do you have any advice for u ?
that 's what you say .
this must be how you practice law in boca raton , by say thing you do n't mean and meaning thing you do n't say .
all right , you be on jeopardy . allow me to alex trebek this and put it in the form of a question : who have be a complete waste of our time ?
marty , let me call you back .
someday , when i 'm up on murder charge , you 'll be hearing from me .
you do n't need him . i 'll represent you .
hi .

hmm . well , i guess it 's just gon na remain a mystery , you know , like whatever happen in that seminar after they dim the light .
well , it be an accident.i be so sorry i lie .
oh , you know , i also lie about the girl in the bathroom . yeah , we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth .
i do n't understand why i ca n't talk at this meeting .
‘ cause when you talk , it enrages people .
okay . quick question . be i allow to exchange pleasantry upon meeting this colonel ?
yes .
be i allow to inform him that colonel sander be never actually in the military ?
fine . ooh . can i use text-to-speech software ?
do n't speak .
aw , nut .
hi .
hello .
it 's a group effort , but i guess if we have to pick a main brain , it would be me .
exactly . yeah , you have a good grasp of the physic .
really ? you 're a physicist ?
oh . well , hey , me , too .
i do n't know how i feel about this .
i 'm not even sure that 's possible .
four month ?
i spent my day alone in the lab wait for a rat to die of anthrax .
well , i come to see how you be feel , but i 'm guess still angry ?
you really think they 're gon na start treat you differently ?
i understand how you feel .
i wish there be some way i could make it well .
uh , actually , i get you apple slice 'cause you 're pregnant .
hi .
hello .
what be you do ?
oh , leonard 's mad at me , so i 'm make him lemon bar .
do he even like lemon bar ?
not really . but i 'm mad at him , too , so lemon bar it be .
something happen at the meeting ?
they make me promise i would n't talk .
and you talk ?
why would that make me feel well ?
why would your bernadette thing make me feel well ? at least mine be educational .
okay . never mind .
look , i 'm sorry . tell me why bernadette be upset with you .
well , i told people at work that she 's pregnant . she be n't ready for them to know .
why would you do that ?
well , it just slip out . i feel terrible .
see , that 's exactly what happen to me , except that i say it on purpose , and i have no regret .
be it even possible to get this do in two month ?
well , maybe . i do n't know . we 'll have to work _ hour a day , seven day a week .
which mean i wo n't be able to make penny breakfast every day , and she 'll realize my brioche french toast be the only thing keep her in the marriage .
i love your french toast .
oh , thanks , man .
so , why do you guy even agree to the deadline ?
we do n't . sheldon do .
and you just let him ?
well , the colonel say it be for the good of the country , and the funding be substantial .
no , but mostly , there be an awkward pause , and i broke it by say okay .
so i guess i wo n't be see you guy for a while .
wow . you 're go off to work with the military , leave me behind . now i know how all those army wife feel .
would you stop ? we 're just gon na be on the other side of campus .
and right here .
you be a deeply silly man .
he be so afraid of his feeling .
oh , hi .
yeah , come on in .
oh , thank you , and i 'm sorry i lie about it .
oh , that 's what amy say . so what 's go on with the research project ? be they gon na let you run it ?
that 's funny . i learn something totally different .
oh , that 's so beautiful .
i never realize this building be classify .
maybe that 's because it 's classify .
wish we be n't so far from my parking space .
the way you put away those lemon bar , perhaps that 's a good thing .
i 'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule .
why ? it clearly do n't work .
i guess this be it .
be that a retinal scanner ?
let 's find out .
no way .
impressive .
oh , my turn , my turn .
i do n't even have to take my glass off
it know .
oh , oh , oh , oh , guy , hold me upside down .
hey , leonard , if you 're not busy tomorrow , i have to do a little reception after work .
oh , i would , but we need to make a push on the air force project .
oh , be you sure ? we 're celebrate our new add drug , and it 'll probably be over in , like , six minute .
do you say you guy be work on the guidance system tomorrow ?
well , sheldon say that he be gon na work with me on our quantum perception project .
we 've have this plan for a week .
well , he reconfirm with me this morning .
guy , before this get ugly , remember , the winner get sheldon .
hey , raj , do you want to go with me tomorrow ?
be you ask because you want me there or out of pity ? actually , never mind , do n't answer . i 'd love to .
hello .
why do you tell leonard you 're work on the gyroscope tomorrow ?
because i be .
but you say you be work with me .
uh-oh . someone 's get two date to the nerd prom .
i have a plan to work on both project simultaneously . and for your information , the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech be nerd prom .
i 'm sorry , what be this plan you have ?
when do that start ?

not only do they eat together , leonard say he make her laugh .
do he purell ?
i can not believe leonard mention the toblerone but left that part out .
i do n't know . we should n't worry her if it 's nothing .
yeah . do you think living with amy have somehow stir up sheldon 's sexual appetite ?
really ? all i get from leonard be the toblerone bar have nut .
and get this , i saw an articulate ladder with dual-leg leveling , which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain .
sound like a big night .

so you 're keep busy ? you 're not lonely ?

no . come on , it 's sheldon . nothing be gon na happen .
that 's what you say to me when i start date him . and then five year later , bingo bango , something happen .

come on . look do n't matter to sheldon . because he only have eye for you .
thanks . i be scramble .
it 's unbelievable . sheldon have lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yell at me .
penny laid into me , too . apparently , i 'm overly fixate on premium swiss chocolate bar .
can you even eat those thing ?
if i take a lactaid a half-hour before and some pepto right after .
sound like a lot of work .
eh , i 'm worth it .
guy . focus . should we do something about nowitzki ?
like what ?
uh , well , she 's single , so if somebody else asks her out and she say yes , then we know she 's not into sheldon .
no offence , stuart , but the woman 's a doctor .
she 's not that kind of doctor .
actually , i be go to suggest me .
great . anybody 's well than , mmm .
dr nowitzki . good to see you .
good to see you .
we should call guinness , that might be a record .
she 's clearly have a work lunch and prefer to eat alone .
you kept walk . i think you do .
do you really think there 's reason to worry ?
yeah , she 's definitely go after sheldon .
i make a play for her and she shot me down .

you get foot and leg , you do it .
will you go with me ?
we 're be ridiculous . there 's no way a woman that attractive be try to seduce sheldon cooper .

okay , i know you do n't have a lot of experience with woman , but ramona seem to have a romantic interest in you .
well , sometimes woman do n't care . sometimes it make them want a guy even more .
that may be true , but dr nowitzki 's just a friend . in fact , i would n't have even notice she 's a woman if she have n't worn that bathing suit that highlight her bosom .
okay . um , let 's try this . think of yourself a one of those limited edition toy people like to collect .
i already do .
well , then you get it .
because there 's only one of me , i 'm more valuable .
right .
although , amy 's already take me out of my package and played with me .
let 's forget the toy thing , okay ? um , maybe
penny , look . i appreciate your concern , but i do n't think that 's what 's happen .
all right . what do you think be happen ?
i think dr nowitzki be a friendly colleague . i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor . and i need to update my resume to include swim a a special skill .
do n't look at me like that , i try .
uh , breakfast yes , lunch no . i do have a cough drop , but that really ride the line between suck and eat .
how thoughtful . thank you .
and i with you . question , be you seek a romantic relationship with me ?

the computation require to overcome the deployability issue be more significant than we thought .
i understand that we 're under contract , and i do n't know what the consequence of violate that be , but , uh , we 're not gon na be able to deliver in the time we promise .
we , we 're think , two year .

of course . you can stay in leonard 's room , and we 'll stay at my place .
you 're sure that 's not an inconvenience ?
no , not at all .
and we live with sheldon , so the word inconvenience have really lose all meaning .
so , technically , i 'd be move in with my boyfriend ?
i guess so . and i 'd finally get to live alone with my husband .
oh , my , this be a big step .
mm-hmm . for two of u , it 's in the right direction .
why be you all smile like crazy people ?
cohabitation with my girlfriend ? that 's a great deal to process .
it 's only for five week .
yeah , and we 'll be right across the hall .
what do you think ?
i do n't know . what if living together kill the romance ?
okay , you guy have sex one whole time . nothing can put out a fire like that .
yeah , but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain ? i mean , she 's never even see me unshaven .
you just shave yesterday . you 're good for three month .
okay . star trek , the original series , the enterprise be on a five-year mission to explore new world . think of this a your personal five-week mission to do the same .
if you want to lure me in with sexy talk , that 's how you do it .
so , be that a yes ?
well , ideally , an enclose , self-sustaining biodome in new mexico , where we would eat crop fertilize with our own waste .
and you be worried about the romance . _
wait . why do n't you guy stay across the hall , and we will live here ?
interest . if my official residence be across the hall , i wonder if i 'd need to knock every time i come over here .
that 's a good question . maybe just do n't come over .
historically , i do n't do well with change .
okay , it wo n't be that bad . we would n't even sit in your spot while you 're go .
you 're darn right , you would n't . no matter where i be , this will always be my spot . like an embassy in a foreign country , this seat be the sovereign soil of my bottom .
just nod and smile . he 's almost go .
sheldon , what do you think ?
very well . i 'm on board .
seriously ?
yes . i accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend .
oh . this be so excite .
well , now , do n't be surprised if , like star trek , it 's cancel in three .
cool . ‘ cause she say you 're do a great job a weird friend who do n't have to be at every appointment .
the polite response be , thank you for notice .
yeah , we could name him blobert .
bloberta . or blobbi with an i .
yeah , i be just think the same thing .
if you want , you can find out right now .
mm .
well , somebody else know because they saw it in the folder .
it be an accident . the doctor left the folder out on her desk . it 's not my fault i open it and look .
so you know the sex of our baby , and we do n't ?
flip a coin . you get a fifty-fifty shot .
it 's unbelievable .
what ? this be not a problem , okay ? if you do n't want to know , i do n't have to tell you .
okay , well , that 's a problem .
you know , i 'm very proud of you for try to live with amy .
oh . thank you .
well , you 've live with your significant other for some time . i would like this experiment to go well . be there any insight you can share ?
mm . well , the biggie be , if she have an insane roommate , kick him out a soon a possible .
you know , leonard and i be very happy before you come along .
i 'm try to think of an answer that wo n't stop you from do this .
i know it sound like a cliche , but compromise be key .
do little thing , like bring her a cup of coffee in bed .
keep m & m 's in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line .
you 're gon na be see each other a lot , so respect each other 's personal space .
he startle easily , so , please , no flash photography .
how many pair of underwear do you pack for the move ?
i do n't know . i do n't count .
that 's me . listen , you and i be gon na be share a bed . you know , this be uncharted territory for both of u . how be you feel about that ?
oh , excite , concerned , a little scar . all the same emotion i feel in line at space mountain .
well , if you 're nervous about the sleep arrangement , maybe we should talk about it .
okay . talk .
well , i imagine one of your concern might be coital expectation .
wow , no foreplay or anything , just right to it .
i 've never live with someone , either . this be a lot for me , too .
this be such a relief . honestly , if it do n't get you all work up , i 'd kiss you right now .
good call . see your teen titan underwear really get my motor run .
i know . they probably should n't sell those to child .
well , here 's your key .
thank you .
enjoy have the place to yourselves .
you enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man have go before .
it 's penny 's bedroom . plenty of men have go before .
now , now , there 's no need to make this emotional .
shall we ?
i guess this be it .
you guy have fun .
you , too . oh , do n't forget . tuesday the air filter need to be change .
yeah , you write it on my hand .
oh . oh , and every other day , check the water level on the avocado pit .
i 'm on it . _ year from now , we 'll make guacamole together .
leonard , please , let me go .
come on , sheldon .
oh . bye .
good night .
good night .
well , that 's it . for the next five week , we be officially living together .
i guess the experiment begin .
yeah .
which side of the bed would you prefer ?
do n't matter to me . your choice .
no , no , we 're living together now , everything 's equal . you know ? i know that i have a tendency to be control , so i would rather you choose .
well , sheldon , i really appreciate that , but these thing mean more to you than they do to me , so whatever you want .
well , i 'm not refuse . i 'm just try to be considerate .
like when you let me get those shoe with the wheel on the bottom , and then watch me roll right into traffic ?
sheldon , will you please just pick a side ?
fine . okay . now , on this side , i be closer to the exit in case of emergency .
great . that 's your side .
no , but i 'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack .
okay , i 'll take that side .
ah , then again , what be the odds of someone attack me ?
rise rapidly .
now , this side offer me proximity to the bathroom , but i be closer to the window where pervert can watch me sleep .
okay . what if we do this ?
i suppose that work .
great .
although now i 'm kind of worried someone 's hiding behind those drape .
i do n't know . maybe the surprise will make it more fun . like magic trick . remember how disappointed you be when i explain the never-ending hanky ?
but how delightful be it when i pull out a bouquet at the end of those scarf ? it 'll be the same thing when the doctor pull a beautiful surprise out of you .
but you do n't listen , and presto change-o , my baby 's inside you . ta-da .
ugh . what be that ? why do you switch side ?
be grateful i 'm still in the room .
comfy ?
oh , i 'm just happy i do n't know what this memory foam remembers .
sheldon ? i know we take coitus off the table , but i be wonder how you feel about other form of intimacy , such a snuggle .
well , it 's funny you should ask , because i be wonder how you 'd feel about separate the two of u with a pillow wall .

believe me , we know what you 're go through .
and i think the most helpful thing we can tell you be no backsies .
mm-hmm .
sheldon , i understand that you like thing a certain way and i 'm willing to make some concession , but you have to be open to compromise .
she 's right . that 's reasonable .
oh , look who 's in favour of compromise , the woman who married leonard hofstadter .
hey , she do n't compromise . she settle . there 's a difference .
yeah . you tell him , babe .

when you live with someone , there 's gon na be conflict . you just have to keep communicate .
well i 'm open to that .
okay . well , for starter , there 's nothing wrong with keep our toothbrush in the same holder .
sheldon , what do you say to that ?
i think we should see other people .

we sleep together once a year . you want other partner ?
do n't blame me . blame your pal , biology . he 's the pervert pull the string here .
you wan na see other people ? go see other people .
i hope one of those people be a monkey , 'cause this be banana .
hey , you can make joke , but if this keep up , he 's gon na move back in here .

good . then before we reintroduce them , we 'll give him one of her sweater so he can get use to her scent again .
so it 's okay for you to joke around ?
no , that 's actually what we do with him when howard come back from space .
honey , how ya feel ? the book say at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be go away . so that 's good news , right ?
there she be . who 's ready for a hot , three-hour car ride to the desert ?
i 'm sorry . we do n't have to go .
how 'bout we stay here ? we do n't even have to tell anyone . it 'll be like a secret vacation at home .
you bet i do .

when we 're sleep , she breathes on me . one night , it get so bad i almost grabbed toto and head for the storm cellar .
leonard breathes on me , too . it 's not a big deal .
she 's always complain about people at work .
well , so do leonard . it 's kind of annoy , but it 's not the end of the world .
do you know that when i get out of the shower , she eye me up and down like i 'm a piece of meat ?
you know , so do leonard . ca n't i just get ready in the morning without him give me his goofy thumbs-up ? hey-hey-hey .

we should call the police .
damn , so do i .

you know i rely on humour in time of stress .
be that the hot tub ?
well , the answer be both more and less disturb than you think .
stuart . he heard me talk about u go away . i guess he decide to invite himself over ?
maybe . how 'bout , hey , you look like a boil chicken breast ?
nah , that 's not gon na hurt his feeling .
why be nothing easy with him ?
i prefer to think of it a high-maintenance .
i prefer to think of myself a five-ten , but i still need to get all my pant hem .
i guess i should have know what i be get myself into .
do n't beat yourself up . you 've never live with anyone before .
that 's true .
and you 're start out with sheldon cooper . that 's like get your first pet and have it be , i do n't know , what 's a kind of pet that ruin your life ?
you 're not make me feel well .
look , even when penny and i start living together , there be a learn curve . but i promise you , it do get easy .
he put a sign up in the bathroom that say , number of day without amy 's hair on the soap .
yeah . my record be six .
maybe this be why people get fish tank . who just turn the porch light on ?
hmm . they must have left the tub on . good thing i stop by . ah . aaaaah ! what be you do here ?
maybe howard and bernadette say i could be here .
answer the question , what be you do here ?
you know , one night , leonard 's nose whistle so loud , i swear it be like sleep on a train track .
have you notice it 's always an a-flat ?
be it ? oh . it 's like his sinus be right here in the car .
if we 're just go to drive around aimlessly , the least you could do be take me for ice cream .
yeah , i 'll take you for ice cream .
be with amy have awoken the sexual creature within . when i see a pretty gal walk down the street , i think , hubba hubba , like any other guy .

nobody do . i be embarrass so i do n't say anything .
he 's in our hot tub drinking our wine .
yeah , yeah , a little .
i 'm in a hot tub with you , so pretty bad .
maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule .
no , do n't do that .
but you do .
exactly . learn from my mistake . no matter where i be at 7:18am , there well be a toilet nearby .
it 's just so much easy to give him what he want .
oh , true , but think of how much you 've accomplish . who get him to stop purelling his pocket change ?
me .
and who get him to put thing other than glove in the glove compartment ?
me . it be mitten .
and who get him to try a turkey dog ?
that be actually koothrappali , but i do let him spit it out in my hand .
how can you stop now ? that 's like walk out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy .
you know , you 're right . i 'm in this relationship , too . i need to stand up for myself .
of course you do .
and if he do n't like it , he can move back here .
oh . he can try . he 'd just need a good locksmith .
well , who you gon na hit on ? the girl in front of u get strawberry . that 's your favourite .
no . no , if we both like it , i 'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and go , aw , no strawberry .
what about the girl behind the counter ?
hmm ? well , she spends her whole day scoop . one arm 's probably big than the other .
be it possible you might not actually want to meet someone ?
you be truly wise .
i 'd say wise beyond your year , but you 're get up there .
all right . come on . what be really go on with you ?
penny , i be go to tell you a story that i 've never told anyone .
all right .
i be _ year old , and on spring break from college .
i know . it 's also why i never open a door without knock three time . i mean , the first one 's traditional , but two and three be for people to get their pant on .
well , what happen with your dad ?
we lock eye , i ran to my room , and we never , ever spoke of it .
you poor thing .
and you 're afraid you 're gon na do something like your dad do ?
yes . i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road .
down the road ? sheldon , she want to share a toothbrush holder with you , and now you 're at an ice cream parlour try to pick up woman .
honey , instead of worry about pain you might cause in the future , how about try to fix the pain you 're cause her right now ?
i 'm sure you 're right . i suppose i should apologize to you , a well .
okay .
that must have hurt watch me look for other woman without ever even consider you . please understand that i think of you a more of a nanny .
just finish your ice cream so i can get you home to bed .
i wonder if this be what it feel like to be bernadette 's baby .
those jet be for my secret spot , not his .
it 's call relax , and that 's all you need to know .
well , it 's get late . maybe we should head home .
you come ?
why ?
yeah ?
you jackass just bought yourselves a hot tub !
what do you think ?
it 's a nice enough spot . you know , if i 'm go to start stand up for myself , this be exactly the kind of thing
we 're back .
oh , hi . hi .
hello .
how you guy do ?
we 're do good . i think sheldon have something he would like to say to amy .
i want to apologize for my behaviour today . it , it be unnecessary . this be warm . oh , and also , i be willing to forego the bathroom schedule .
why do she get that ? we never get that .
do you want him back ?
amy , you should know i be never really interested in see other woman . and to prove how serious i be about u , i 'm willing to take our relationship to the next level .
amy farrah fowler , will you share this toothbrush holder with me ?
i would love to .
do we really need to be here for this ?

okay , well , i may have go a bit overboard , but you ca n't put a price on safety .
though if you do , it 's more zero than you 're expect .
but it 's the safest crib you can buy . and if you do n't like it , we can return it .
in our new minivan . hey , what 's for lunch ?
it 's for the baby , and i do n't buy it . the dealer loan it to me for a 24-hour test drive .

i be terrify of step on a nail and fall into a butt crack .
anyway , how about dinner ?
you know , if you 'd like , i could call your landlord and complain .
thanks , but you do n't have to .
oh , i do n't mind , i 'm very good at complain . if it be an olympic sport , i 'd complain about what a stupid sport it be and then i 'd take home the gold .
good stuff . so , uh , what about dinner ?
be it me , or be you purposely change the subject ?
i have a feel you 're still do it . but i find that topic irresistible , so , now , in ancient mesopotamia , the king refer to the people a his property .
i 'm serious , jpl 's actually develop a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hit u .
so their plan for save the earth from armageddon be hop a bunch of scientist can catch a ball ?
if we 're all gon na die , why be i eat so much kale ?
you 're awful quiet , everything okay ?
i 'm concerned about amy . she 's act a bit odd lately .
oh . well , just out of curiosity , what register a odd to you ?
her behaviour . no , i have the feel that she 's hiding something .
i would n't worry about it . she 's probably just distract by work .
you heard him , guy , do n't ask .
why would she keep something from me , you know ? i share my body with that woman . and my netflix password . they recommend stella get her groove back because of her .
buddy , buddy , listen , nothing bad be go on , she just , she just do n't want you to know that the work on her apartment be finish a couple week ago .
i do n't understand .
yes .
oh . well , i feel both flatter and hurt . like when people say i look like that skeleton from nightmare before christmas .
sheldon , this be not a big deal . it 's a little white lie , everyone do it .
eat cake on the toilet single .
well , i wo n't tolerate deception in my relationship . i have no choice but to confront her .
do n't do that , you 've get gold here . hang onto it until you 're in trouble and then throw it in her face .
why would you tell him that ? that 's terrible advice .
well , of course not .
uh , no .
i 'll take that a a yes . she 's secretly be move your collectible into storage a little at a time and you have n't notice .
be you kid me ?
see , i 've know that for week , but , you know , i wait till the moment when it would cause him the most pain .
superman 's go , my stormtrooper 's go .
your klingon word-of-the-day calendar 's go .
i 'd say damn it in klingon , but that be n't until next month .
it 's khoo-vakh .
khoo-vakh ! she take my where 's waldo .

oh , yeah , there he be .
so , what 's the deal with your apartment ? why 's it take so long ?
um , it be a drywall problem .
well , the drywall get wet , and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall get wet , it 's really more
wet wall ?
or damp wall , just a bad .
mm . so why do n't they just get more drywall ?
well , they go to get some , but the woman at the wall store say it be go on sale and they should wait because the saving
okay , be you do ? bernadette told me your apartment 's ready .
i be do at wet wall , but you would n't let it go .
well , he start to question it , but then i fake sneeze on him and he ran to take a shower . please do n't say anything , i feel terrible about this .
oh , do n't worry , i wo n't .
thanks .
the woman at the wall store ?
let it go .
be you go to confront penny ?
eventually , i guess . although , i be kind of curious how long she think she can keep hiding my stuff without me know .
hmm . you know , perhaps instead of confront them , we should see how far they 're willing to spin their tangle web . like that spider-man action figure that use to be on your desk .
oh , my god , i 'm go blind .
hi .
food 's here .
excellent . i 'm very hungry . speak of which , what 's go on with your apartment ?

despite recent event , i do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have be positive .
be you say you 'd like to live with me ?
i 'm open to the possibility .
ubamy bube cubool .
whatever .
you know , if he move across the hall for good , leonard could keep the stuff you do n't like in sheldon 's old room . solves everything .
that 's a great idea .
ooh , maybe i could turn it into a game den .
that would be amaze .

bert be study the way microbe in rock can survive in extreme environmental condition .
they say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planet .
you know what , i 've met bert . be n't he an indicator of life on other planet ?
you use to make those joke about me . now everything be bert , bert , bert .

oh , good . then you wo n't be disappointed .
what make you think she would n't have sex with me , i 'm a male and she 's a female ?
yes , but not of the same specie .
i 'm not go to engage in hypothetical here , i 'm just try to be a good neighbour .
oh , of course .
that 's not to say that if a carnal relationship be to develop that i would n't participate . however briefly .
do you think this possibility will be help or hinder when she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo ?

what ? oh we just have to mail some letter and throw away some chicken .
you 'll never guess what just happen .
oh , i give up .
i do n't guess . a a scientist i reach conclusion base on observation and experimentation , although a i 'm say this it occurs to me you may have be employ a rhetorical device render my response moot .
what be that ?
believe it or not , personal growth . what happen ?
i have a conclusion base on an observation .
no you do n't . no he do n't .
well , the girl they picked to play mimi , she drop out and they ask me to replace her .
oh , congratulation , what a lucky break .
it 's not a big deal , just a one night showcase , but they invite a lot of cast people and agent so , you never know .
i think i know .
it 's this friday at eight , you guy want to come ?
because . uh , friday , we be attend a symposium on molecular positronium .
i think that 's a week from tuesday at six .
no , it 's this friday , at eight .
oh , too bad , well , i get to get to rehearsal , see you guy .
yes , i do .
and you do it so casually , no rapid breathing , no increase in perspiration .
so ?
so , lack of a physiological response while lie be characteristic of a violent sociopath .
sheldon , be you worried about your safety .
no , i imagine if you be go to kill me you 'd have do it a long time ago .
that 's very true .
leonard , leonard , leonard
what ?
i need to speak to you .
it 's two o'clock in the morning
it 's important .
i highly doubt that . go away . . be you still out there ?
yes .
what ?
you 're right , it can wait until morning .
what , what , what , what , what ?
never mind . i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle , you 're in no state to talk .
i 'm uncomfortable have be include in your lie to penny .
what be i suppose to say .
you could have told her the truth .
that would have hurt her feeling .
be that a relevant factor ?
yes .
and what would i have say afterwards ?
why ?
it 's the social protocol , it 's what you do when you have a friend who 's proud of something they really suck at .
i be not aware of that .
well now you be .
yes .
when we played chess earlier , you be terrific and i ca n't wait to play you again . goodnight .
leonard , leonard , leonard , leonard , …..
oooaw . this would be so much easy if i be a violent sociopath . what ?
i be analyse our lie , and i believe we 're in danger of penny see through the ruse .
how ?
penny , penny , penny , good morning .
do you have any idea what time it be ?
remember how leonard told you we could n't come to your performance because we be attend a symposium on molecular positronium ?
i remember symposium .
yes , well , he lie .
wait , what ?
he lie , and i 'm feel very uncomfortable about it .
well imagine how i 'm feel .
hungry ? tire ? i 'm sorry this really be n't my strong suit .
you told her i lie , why would you tell her i lie ?
to help you .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not see the help .
she be go to see through your lie eventually , so i told her that you be lie to protect me .
oh , i 'm get a bad feel .
hunger ? indigestion , i 'm sorry i 'm really not very good at this . anyway , penny now believe that on friday night , we 're go to participate in my cousin leopold 's drug intervention .
your cousin leopold ?
what 's important ?
detail , leonard , the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turn on detail .
do you have a cousin leopold .
no , i make him up . i think you 'd call him lee .
i do n't get it , i already told her a lie , why replace it with a different lie ?
well , first of all , your lie be laughably transparent , where mine be exquisitely convolute . while you be sleep i be weave an un-unravelable web .
un-unravelable ?
yes , if she google leopold houston she 'll find a facebook page , an online blog depict his descent into drug use , and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com .
okay , why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing .
ah , because it 's in long beach , and i do n't drive .
we 're go to long beach ?
no , of course not , there 's no cousin leo , there 's no intervention , focus leonard .
oh , come on !
we just leave the house on friday night , and we return in the wee hour emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab .
so he go back into rehab ?
yes , but , he can relapse if penny ever invite u to go hear her sing again .
you still told her i lie .
for a noble purpose , to spare me the social embarrassment of have a drug-addled first cousin , which i 'm assume be embarrass , yes ?
i do n't know . how be i suppose to remember all of this .
un-unravelable .
oh hey penny , wow , look at you , all ready for your showcase , you look great .
thanks . i just want to come by and wish you guy luck with your symposium .
oh , well , thankyou .
it 's okay , leonard
oh , okay , alright , good .
oh boy , group hug .
uh-huh !
uh-huh ?
okay . so what 's up ?
howard , i 'm sorry we're we 're
no , no , you 're quark-blocking u .
wow .
howard , listen
no , it 's okay , it 's your millenium falcon , you and chewbacca do whatever you want to do . me and princess leia here will find some other way to spend the even .
okay , sure . i do n't see a problem with that .
there 's no symposium , leonard lie to me , be n't that right leonard .
well i do n't know what to say .
it 's okay , i do , look , leonard be help sheldon through a family crisis , he make up the whole story about the symposium with dr farmin..farm…ian
good for you .
hah , yeah ! because he do n't want sheldon to be embarrass , and there be nothing to be embarrass okay , every family in america have a relative hole up in a garage somewhere huff paint thinner .
no , i 'm lose too , i think she skip a step .
alright you guy , good luck .
thanks penny .
yeah , uh , break a leg .
break a leg .
so , road trip to long beach .
no , we 're not go to long beach .
why not ?
because sheldon do n't have a drug addict cousin leopold .
oh , too bad . i 've always want to go to long beach .
it 's a very nice community . the queen mary be docked there , once the large ocean liner in the world , it 's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly grip murder mystery dinner .
sound fun .
i 'm game .
shotgun .
no , no , no , leonard get nauseous unless he sits in front , and even then it 's iffy .
leonard , leonard , leonard
let it go , sheldon , the murderer be the first mate whether it make sense to you or not .
sadly , it 's not . substance abuse be a lifelong struggle , but beyond that i have realise that the leo i described would not have agree to go to rehab .
why not ?
because leo be a middle child .
there be no leo , how can you say that ?
great , what be it ?
who be you ?
oh , god ! sheldon do not have a cousin leo .
for your information , this be all base on solid research , stick with the character profile i write for you .
sheldon ?
i 'm sorry , leonard , this be toby loobenfeld , he 's a research assistant in the particle physic lab , but he also minored in theatre at mit .
yeah , i get it , sheldon , why ?
well , you see , while leo would not have go into rehab , it be completely plausible that we would have talk him into leave the motel , and come home with u .
oh !
no . we 're go with middle child , and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production .
unfortunately , we be n't able to convince him to go to rehab .
well , base on what you told me , i 'm not surprised .
but we do convince him to leave the motel . come say hello . leo , this be penny , our friend and neighbour .
hi leo , how be you feel ?
no .
well , that 's leo . hey , um , why do n't you tell me about your showcase last night ?
oh , it be okay i guess , be n't a big turn out but they both really seem to like it .
there be only two people there ?
by the end . yeah .
i'm i 'm sorry .
there have be study .
how could there be a double blind study , who would be the control group .
a you can see , detox can get pretty ugly , let 's give them some privacy .
yeah . hey , do you want to come over to my place , have coffee ?
sound good .
i have a video of me sing last night , do you want to see it ?
gee , why would n't i ?
this be even well than you come to the showcase , because now i get to watch you watch me .
your parent make the right decision .
leo , you be a very sweet , really funny guy . you 're gon na do okay .
how long be he go to stay here .
he 's a homeless drug addict , leonard , where be he go to go ? boy , you have a lot to learn about lie .
checkmate .
o-o-o-o-h ! again ?
obviously you 're not well suit for three-dimensional chess , perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed .
just reset the board .
it must be humble to suck on so many different level .
hi guy .
hey !
do you get my mail .
yeah , right here . how be nebraska ?
oh , well than north dakota ! i guess that joke 's only funny in nebraska .
from the data at hand you really ca n't draw that conclusion . all you can say with absolute certainty be that that joke be not funny here .
boy , it 's good to be back .
how be your family ?
ugh , it be the bad trip , everyone get sick over the weekend .
here we go .
what kind of sick ?
oh , the flu i guess .
i do n't need you to guess , i need you to know , now when do the symptom first appear ?
maybe friday .
friday , be that morning or afternoon ?
i i don't
think woman , who blew their nose and when ?
sheldon , relax , she do n't have any symptom , i 'm sure she 's not contagious .
thanks for your consideration , now please leave .
you 'd well go before he start spray you with lysol .
okay , well , thank you for get my mail .
no problem . welcome home .
what ?
what the hell be you do ?
i 'm make petrie dish to grow throat culture .
i need a growth medium , and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt . here , swab my throat .
sheldon , you be not sick . this be , but you be not .
we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny have introduce into our environment . and have never be to nebraska i 'm fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibody .
sheldon , do n't you think you 're overreact ?
when i 'm lie comatose in a hospital rely on inferior mind to cure me , these jello culture and my accompany note will give them a fight chance .
i 'm go back to bed .
wait . put this in the bathroom .
what for ?
i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidney be n't shut down .
i mix pancake batter in this !

sorry . found ‘ em .
well if you leave now , you can be back before the gorilla rip the crap out of charlton heston .
unless sheldon 's there , in which case you 'll be trap forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web .
would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with sheldon , or have a stranger carve out your cornea with a laser beam ?
well ?
i 'm think !
okay , nice and cosy , okay , i 'll see you later .
wait . will you please rub this on my chest .
oh , sheldon , ca n't you do that yourself ?
vaporub make my hand smell funny .
but sheldon .

soft kitty , warm kitty
little ball of fur . keep rub .
little ball of fur .
what do you see , what do you see .
okay , he must be in his bedroom . my spare glass be in my bedroom , on my dresser , next to my bat-signal .
i 'm not go in there .
raj ?
well i ca n't do it , i ca n't see anything .
it 's all right , wireless mini-cam and bluetooth headset . we 'll be your eye .
fine .
no , you 'll be on your hand and knee . now you 'll need to get the sensor a close a you can to sheldon 's room .
well , how do i carry it if i 'm on my hand and knee ?
what ?
it mean go straight .
then just say go straight .
you do n't stay go straight when you 're give bearing , you say keep true .
alright i just hit my head .
because you do n't keep true . okay , turn right .
the the picture 's break up .
no .
then why do i have to crawl ?
oh , i guess you do n't .
okay , it 's on .
good . from this point forward you will have to crawl .
i know .
hang on , the sensor 's pick up something , turn your head back .
you rat bastard .
told you the sensor would work .
hi !
you deliberately stuck me with sheldon .
well , i have to , you see what he 's like .
penny ! penny , i 'm hungry .
uh , it 's okay , sweetie , good news , leonard 's home !
no !
here you go , good luck , bye .
w-wait !
leonard , i 'm hungry !
wait ! penny ! take me with you !
i want grill cheese .
do you think penny will come here and take care of u ?
i do n't think penny 's ever come here again .
i 'm very congest .
yeah , so ?
can you go to the kitchen , and get me the turkey baster label mucus .
if i stand , i 'll vomit .
under the sink , yellow tupperware bowl .
here 's the problem with teleportation .
lay it on me .
personally , i would never use a transporter . because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrate in order to create a new sheldon .
would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon ?
no , he would be exactly the same .
that be a problem .
so , you see it too .
graduate work , very impressive .
advantage kim .
excuse me , that be my research , and it be by no mean a dead end .
you can count on u , we 're on it . what the hell do you mean , dead end .
i sense a disturbance in the force .
a bad feel i have about this , mmm-hmmm .
so , dennis , how long have you be in america .
what be you talk about ?
come on , sheldon , we 've hardly show him anything .
keen observation , goodbye .
leonard .
huh , yeah ?
get him out .
come on , dennis , i 'll show you the rec centre , they 've get nautilus equipment .
not heavy one .
you think i have n't consider it ? you really think i have n't consider it ?
get him out leonard .
come on , dennis , i 'll show you the radiation lab .
yes , in fact i be the young person ever to win it .
fourteen and a half .
it 's like look into an obnoxious little mirror , be n't it ?
mmm , this be really delicious , be n't it ? still ca n't talk to me unless you 're drunk , huh ? oh , sweetie , you be so damage .
hey , i 'm damage too . how about a hug for howie ?
sure . raj , hug howard .
uh-uh-uh .
something you 'd like to share ? a tale of woe perhaps .
fifteen year old . dennis kim be fifteen year old , and he 's already correct my work . today i go from be wolfgang amadeus mozart to you know , that other guy .
antonio salieri ?
oh , god , now even you 're smarter than me .
you know , sheldon , you do n't have so many friend that you can afford to start insult them .
just eat , sheldon , you 'll feel well .
why waste food . in texas when a cow go dry they do n't keep feed it , they just take her out and shoot her between the eye .
i 'm confuse , do sheldon stop give milk ?
you ca n't let this kid get to you . you always knew that someday someone would come along who be young and smarter .
yes , but i assume i would have be dead hundred of year , and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg .
so , you 've get a bit of competition , i really do n't see what the big deal be .
well of course you do n't , you 've never excel at anything .
i do n't understand , exactly how do he get any friend in the first place ?
we like leonard .
well , what be you go to do , sheldon , give up ?
hey .
hey .
i 've decide you 're right . my career be not over .
great .
great .
so i 've decide , i 'm go to collaborate with you .
great .
what exactly be it you do ? i know you chatter on about it all the time , but i 've never really paid attention .
okay , well , right now i 'm design an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level , but i really do n't need any help .
oh , sure you do . now , see , what 's this here in the schematic , be that a laser array ?
yes .
no . hmmm . what happens if you use argon laser instead of helium neon ?
it would blow up .
be you sure ?
pretty sure .
pretty sure 's not very scientific , be this how you normally work , just hunch and guess and stuff ?
go away .
if you 're concerned about share credit with me , you 're name can go first i 'm go .
i 'll talk to you later .
engineering . where the noble semi-skilled labourer execute the vision of those who think and dream . hello , oompah-loompahs of science .
sheldon , what be you do here ?
i just come by to say hello .
i 've be at this lab for three year , you 've never come by to say hello .
well , up until now i 've have well thing to do . so , what be we make today ?
a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that 's go up on the next space shuttle .
really , how do it work ?
when this be do , it will be attach to the payload bay , and the sensor apparatus will rest on it .
no , you do n't understand , during acceleration it need to stay perfectly level and provide yeah , okay , it 's a shelf .
now , i notice you 're use titanium , do you give any consideration to carbon nanotube , they 're lighter , cheaper and half twice the tensile strength .
sheldon , there 's a diploma in my office that say i have a master in engineering .
and you also have a note from your mother that say i love you , bubbula . but neither of those be a cogent argument for titanium over nanotube .
sheldon .
yes .
go away .
do leonard tell you to say that ?
no , i thought of it all by myself .
huh . it ca n't be a coincidence . there must be some causal link i 'm miss .
go away .
curiouser and curiouser .
be he here ?
if he be , i would n't be .
do you know what he do . he watch me work for ten minute , and then start to design a simple piece of software that could replace me .
be that even possible ?
well , what if something be to happen to this boy so he be no longer a threat to sheldon ?
then our problem would be solve .
hang on , be we talk about murder dennis kim ? i 'm not say no .
we do n't have to go that far , there be other mean available .
the only thing we need to do be make this kim kid lose his focus .
that wo n't happen , he 's not interested in anything but physic .
what about biology ?
what ?
you know , biology ? the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind .
howard , he 's fifteen .
yeah , so , when i be fifteen i met denise polmerry and my grade point average fell from a _ to a _ .
she be sleep with you ?
no , i just waste a lot of time think about what it would be like if she do .
we need a hot fifteen year-old asian girl with a thing for smart guy .
what ?
howard , that 's racist , any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick .
it 's possible she may have misunderstood u .
no , no , please , come in . yeah , i think you 'll appreciate this , very excite .
the jewish people .
we 'll make it nice , put out a spread .
of course he have , the oracle told u little neo be the one . you can see the matrix , ca n't you .
ah , la-la-la , hava nagila . they 'll come , they 'll settle and i 'll win the prize
i really do n't understand your objection , professor goldfarb , why would n't the senoran desert make a perfectly good promise land ?

like what ? we ca n't get fifteen year-old girl drunk .
or can we ?

i do n't think you mean we ca n't . i think you mean we should n't .
no , i have allergy .
okay , uh , how about her ?
interest , kind of pretty , a little chubby so probably low self-esteem .
i think that 's our girl . one of u should go talk to her .
i ca n't talk to her , you do it .
i ca n't just go up and talk to her . howard , you talk to her .
oh no , she 'll never go for the kid once she get a peek at this .
you know , if we be in india this would be simpler . five minute with her dad , twenty goat and a laptop and we 'd be do .
well , we 're not in india .
alright , why do n't we do it your way then ? we 'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for month on end .
okay , that be uncalled for .
you start it , dude .
the kid get a girl .
unbelievable .
do anyone see how he do it ?
yeah , mission accomplish .

i 'd be more interested in a scene depict spock 's conception .
oh , please . for vulcan , mating , or , if you will , pon farr , it 's an extremely private matter .
still , i 'd like to know the detail . his mother be human , his father be vulcan , they could n't just conceive .
maybe they have to go to a clinic . imagine spock 's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ear and shapely rear .
how come on star trek everybody 's private part be the same . no alien lady ever told captain kirk , hey , get your thing out of my nose .
hi , can you help me , i be write an email and the a key get stuck . now it 's just go “ aaaaaaa ” .

come on , you need a four person team , we 're four people .
by that reason we should also play bridge , hold up a chuppah and enter the olympic bobsled competition .
i want ticket to that please .
sheldon , what , do i need to quote spock 's die word to you .
no , do n't .
the need of the many .
outweigh the need of the few .
okay . first order of physic bowl business . we need a truly kick-ass team name . suggestion .
how about the perpetual motion squad ? it 's beyond the law of physic , plus a little head up for the lady .
the lady ?
perpetual motion squad , we can go all night .
i do n't . team be traditionally name after fierce creature , thus intimidate one opponent .
then we can be the bengal tiger .
poor choice . gram for gram , no animal exceeds the relative fight strength of the army ant .
maybe so . but you ca n't incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnify glass .
let 's put it to a vote . all those in favour .
i will yield .
after we go through the exercise of an annoy series of vote , all of which the gentleman will lose , do he then intend to threaten to quit if he do not get his way ?
he do .

okay . what artificial satellite have see glimpse of einstein predict frame drag ?
and of course it 's gravity probe b .
sheldon , you have to let somebody else answer .
why ?
because it 's polite .
what do manner have to do with it ? this be war . be the roman polite when they salt the ground of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again ?
leonard , you say i only have to ask question .
the objective of the competition be to give correct answer , if i know them , why should n't i give them ?
some of u might have the correct answer too .

a time share time machine ? i 'm in . sheldon ?
need you ask ? but i still do n't understand why no-one else bid .
i understand why no-one else bid .
do the listing actually say miniature ?
i just assume . who sell a full size time machine for $ _ ?
in a venn diagram , that would be an individual locate within the intersection of the set “ no longer want my time machine ” and “ need $ _ ” .
it 's actually a tremendous bargain , even with shipping it work out to less than four dollar a pound .
cocktain shrimp be $ _ .
how be we go to get it upstairs ?
if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator .
yes but the elevator 's be broken for two year .
i 've be meaning to ask you , do you think we should make a call about that ?
if i push any harder i 'm go to give birth to my colon .
it 's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go , basic physic .
sheldon ?
yeah .
if my finger ever work again , i 've get a job for the middle one .
oh , hey guy .
uh , hi penny . take a break , guy !
what be you do ?
what be it ?
it's you know , time machine .
yeah , okay , neat , but i really get to get to work , so .
uh , just give u a few minute .
i do n't have a few minute , i 'm run really late .
oh , i never joke when it come to vertigo .
damn , okay , i 'll just take the roof .
for what it 's worth , i thought it be humorous .
let 's just do this . guy , ready to push ?
in a minute . howard step outside to throw up .
i do n't know what you be worried about . i think it really work in the room .
yeah . it be by far the coolest thing i have ever own .
i be go to put down a towel .
that sound fair .
hold on . bi-monthly be an ambiguous term , do you mean move it every other month , or twice a month ?
then no .
okay , every other month .
no .
wait a minute , i 'd want to see that too .
so , when it 's your turn you can .
but if we all go back to the same point in time , bell 's lab be go to get very crowd , he 'll know something 's up .
also , since the time machine do n't move in space , you 'll end up in _ pasadena .
oh , i have a solution , first go into the future and obtain a cloak device .
ooh , how far into the future ?
if i remember correctly , captain kirk will steal a cloak device from the romulans on stardate _ , which will be january 10th _ by pre-federation reckon .
okay , i be set the dial for january 10th , _ . here we go into the future . that be fun .
my turn .
okay , first of all , what you call a gap be nearly three foot wide , i slip and skin my knee .
be you okay ?
it be eight course of lamb , and they try to fix me up with their son .
sorry .
not do . by the time i finally get to work , they 'd give my shift away . yeah , that 's right , i 've lose an entire day 's pay thanks to this this
time machine .
the light flash and the dish spin , you wan na try it ?
no ! i do n't want to try it , my god , you be grown men , how could you waste your life with these stupid toy and costume and comic book and and now that that
again , time machine .
oh please , it 's not a time machine , if anything it look like something elton john would drive through the everglades .
it only move in time . it would be bad than useless in a swamp .
pathetic . all of you , completely pathetic .
my turn !
leonard , it 's two in the morning .
so it 's my turn . why do you set it for the day before yesterday ?
because i want to go back and keep myself from get a time machine .
what if i knock you unconscious right now ?
it wo n't change the past .
but it would make the present so much nicer .
be you upset about something ?
what be your first clue ?
well , it be a number of thing . first the late hour , then your demeanour seem very low energy , plus your irritability
yes i 'm upset .
oh ! i do n't usually pick up on those thing . good for me .
yeah , good for you .
oh , wait . do you want to talk about what 's bother you ?
wow , i 'm on fire tonight .
uh , here 's the thing . girl like penny never end up with guy who own time machine .
i disagree . your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine . that failure clearly stand on it own .
thanks for point it out .
well of course they 're movie . be you expect me to come up with an example involve a real life time machine ? that 's absurd .
come on , guy , push .
if i push any harder i 'm go to give birth to my colon .
oh , hey guy .
uh , hi penny . take a break , guy !
what be you do ?
oh , just , you know , move a time machine .

we brought food .
lox and bagel , the breakfast of time traveller .

because i do n't want it any more .
why ?

my spidey-sense tell me this have something to do with penny .
look , do you want to buy me out or not ?
i 'll give you a hundred dollar , which will make me half owner , and we 'll put it on my balcony .
i paid two hundred dollar for my share .
dude , everyone know a time machine loses half it value the minute you drive it off the lot .
i 'll go for two hundred , that time machine stay right where it be .
three hundred , and i 'll throw in my original _ mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effect .
no , no more toy or action figure or prop or replica or costume or robot or darth vader voice changer , i 'm get rid of all of it .

wow , you do n't look that much alike .
can i get a hallelujah .
fraternal twin come from two separate egg , they be no more alike than any other sibling .

hey , guess what . i 've be accepted a a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness .
hey , good for you , raj .
yes , i 'm very hopeful . hello missy . they mention there may be side effect .
so , missy . have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india ?
ah yes , dr patel , good man .
do you like motorcycle , ‘ co i ride a hog .
a hog ? you have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front .
you still have to wear a helmet .
have you ever heard of the kama sutra ?
the indian sex book . in other word if you wonder wonder who write the book of love , it be u .
hey , sheldon 's sister 's pretty cute , i w .
i be n't star !
i do n't say you be , i just say she be cute .
oh . huh , um , maybe , if you like woman who be tall and perfect .
sheldon , why be you ignore your sister ?
i 'm not ignore my sister . i 'm ignore all of you .
i brought snack .
onion dip , it 's onion dip .
we do n't entertain much .
missy , do you enjoy pajama ?
we indian invent them . you 're welcome .
yeah , well my people invent circumcision . you 're welcome !
you 're welcome .
bye missy .
bye missy , see you .
goodbye leonard !
okay , you two have to back off .
excuse me , this be my apartment and she 's my roommate 's sister .
how do i have penny ? in what universe do i have penny ?
so i can have penny ?
excuse me , can i interject something . i 'm order pizza online , be everyone okay with pepperoni ?
sheldon , can i talk to you in private ?
i guess . do n't worry , i be go to order you cheeseless .
thank you .
that 's okay . lactose intolerance be nothing to be embarrass about .
hey , look at me , i do n't have a foreskin .
sheldon , be you aware that your sister be an incredibly attractive woman ?
hmmm ? she certainly have the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable . it 's noteworth that at other point in history , heavier woman be the standard for beauty because their girth suggest affluence .
that 's fascinate , but i
i do n't say it be fascinate , i say it be noteworthy .
alright , note . but my point be that koothrappali and wolowitz they 're hit on your sister .
that 's great , but i .
what i 'm say be that we take quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis .
whatever . you have to do something about it .
why ?
because she 's your sister .
i do n't understand . yes , we share a uterus for nine month , but since then we 've pretty much go our own separate way .
okay , uh . oh , consider this . with your father go , it be your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate .
i have n't consider that . we do share dna .
uh-huh .
so there be the possibility , however remote , that rest in her loin be the potential for another individual a remarkable a myself .
exactly . and , you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister 's future offspring .
you 're right . if someone want to get at missy 's fallopian tube , they 'll have to go through me .
i be shiva the destroyer , i will have the woman !
alright , that 's enough juvenile squabble , stop it , stop it i say . i 'm go to settle this right now . neither of you be good enough for my sister .
who be you to decide that ?
he 's the man of his family , you have to respect his wish .
you 're out too , by the way .
say what ?
it 's nothing personal , i 'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew do n't become flatulent every time they eat an eskimo pie .
what be you so happy about ?
i 'm not happy , it 's the medication , i ca n't stop smile .
now that leonard 's make me aware of how high the genetic stake be , we have to face the fact that none of you be suitable mate for my sister .
wait a minute . leonard make you aware of that ?
we all make mistake , let 's move on .
excuse me , but i think you 're miss a big opportunity here .
how so ?
everybody know genetic diversity produce the strong offspring . why not put a little mocha in the family latte .
in principle you have a point , but a a practical matter , need i remind you that it take experimental pharmaceutical to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex .
i think you 're focus entirely too much on the drug .
this have nothing to do with religion . this have to do with the fact that you 're a tiny , tiny man who still life with his mother .
sheldon , you be really be unreasonable .
be i ? here . eat this cheese without fart and you can sleep with my sister .
oops .
why do everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone ? usually nobody want to be alone with me .
we all make mistake , let 's move on .
truthfully , i 've never give it any thought , but it have be point out to me that you carry dna of great potential .
let me explain . you see , i 'm a superior genetic mutation , an improvement on the exist mediocre stock .
that would be you . but reside within you be the potential for another me . perhaps even taller , smarter and less prone to freckle , a sheldon _ if you will .
exactly . now , i be not say that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with . if you 're not attract to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduce .
not at all . frequent coitus dramatically increase the odds of fertiliziation .
you donate egg . we will place them in cryogenic storage . i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your egg , have them fertilize and implant in you , that way everybody win .
correction . missy can date whoever she want .
look , we have to settle this .
i agree . sheldon 's sister be hiding at penny 's because we 've all be hit on her at the same time .
she 's not hiding . she need privacy to call her grandmother who 's apparently very sick . oh , and then i believe she have to wash her hair .
oh , you poor , delude bastard .
you want to go again ? let 's go .
sit down .
okay .
if we 're go to fight over missy , let 's do it the right way . the honourable way .
and he 's down !
come on , come on , get up .
stay down , bitch . yeah , ha ha , natural selection at work .
i weep for humanity .
excuse me while i go tell missy the good news .
hi penny , how 's it go . listen , that guy mike that you be date , be that still go on ?
nothing , just catch up . by the way , may i speak to missy please ?
well , since you 're leave tomorrow i be wonder if you 'd like to go out to dinner with me ?
oh . you have other plan , or ?
oh . alright uh enjoy the rest of your even .
what do you want , howard ?
i 'm fine , thanks for ask . i 've come to call on missy .
missy ?
the amaze howard . do you like magic ?
then you be in for a treat . behold , an ordinary cane . da-dah !
okay .
missy ?
thank you . i apprec . apprec . appreeee . oh-oh .
oh , honey , be your medication wear off ?
well , she might be interested to know that i have refocus my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory .
okay , well , it be pleasant see you , other than that business with my testicle .
really ?
you tell people i 'm a rocket scientist ?
i 'm a theoretical physicist .
what 's the difference ?
my god ! why do n't you just tell them i 'm a toll taker at the golden gate bridge ? rocket scientist , how humiliate .
hey , guy , guy , some of the other waitress want me to ask you something .
oh , it 's call trestling .
it combine the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetri into the ultimate sport .
yeah , that 's terrific , but what they want me to ask you be to cut it the hell out . right come on guy , come on . happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you
we might a well stop , it 's a stalemate . you 're beating me in tetri , but you 've get the upper body strength of a keebler elf .
keebler elf ? i 've get your keebler elf right here . okay , it 's a stalemate .
so leonard , will we be see you on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake ?
okay , he can have carrot cake .
what about the cream cheese frost .
he can scrape it off .
i do your horoscope , remember , i be go to do everybody 's until sheldon go on one of his typical psychotic rant .
for the record , that psychotic rant be a concise summation of the research of bertram forer , who in _ prove conclusively through meticulously design experiment , that astrology be nothing but pseudo scientific hokum .
blah blah blah , a typical taurus . so , seriously , be we go to see you saturday ?
oh , i do n't think so .
why not ?
i do n't celebrate my birthday .
shuddup , yeah you do .
no , it 's no big deal , it 's just the way i be raise . my parent focus on celebrate achievement , and be expel from a birth canal be not consider one of them .
uh , that 's so silly .
it 's actually base on very sound theory , his mother publish a paper on it .
what be it call , “ i hate my son and that 's why he ca n't have cake ? ”
thank you .
well i love birthday , wake up to mom 's special french toast breakfast , wear the birthday king crown , play laser tag with all my friend .
yeah , see , that 's what kid should have .
actually that be last year .
so you 've really never have a birthday party ?
uh , it turn out my grandfather have die .
oh my god , that 's terrible .
oh , it be kind of like a birthday party . i get to see all my cousin and there be cake , so
that 's the saddest thing i 've ever heard .
you think ? go ahead , tell her about your senior prom .
make sure they remember no peanut .
hello penny . leonard just left .
i know . i want to talk to you .
what would we talk about ? we 've no overlap area of interest i 'm aware of , and you know i do n't care for chit-chat .
okay , can you just let me in .
well alright , but i do n't see this a a promising endeavour .
okay , here 's the deal , we be go to throw leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday .
i hardly think so , leonard make it very clear he do n't want a party .
do someone say party ?
i suppose that 's possible , but for the record , i 've never have a threesome and yet i still know i want one .
howard , here 's the difference . the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freeze over .
fine . if i do have a threesome , you ca n't be part of it . i 'm just kid , yes you can . can you bring a friend ?
i think a birthday party be a terrible idea . i envy leonard for grow up without that anguish .
anguish ?
have i point out that i be extremely uncomfortable with dance , loud music and most other form of alcohol induced frivolity .
nevertheless we be .
in addition i really do n't think that leonard want a
well of course i oh ! yeah , i have an idea , let 's throw leonard a kick as birthday party .
that 's not the secret knock . this be the secret knock .
what difference do it make ?
the whole point of a secret knock be to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one 's co-conspirators .
be that raj and howard ?
possibly , but unverified .
can you just let u in .
luckily for you this be not a nuclear reactor .
so , what do you get the birthday boy ?
well , raj get him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture base on alex ross 's definitive batman , and i get him this amaze autograph copy of the feynman lecture on physic .
nice . i get him a sweater .
okay , well , he might like that , i 've see him chilly .
uh , sheldon , i do n't see your present .
that 's because i do n't bring one .
well why not ?
do n't ask .
the entire institution of gift give make no sense .
too late .
well , sheldon , you 're his friend . friend give each other present .
i accept your premise , i reject your conclusion .
try tell him it 's a non-optional social convention .
what ?
it 's a non-optional social convention .
he come with a manual .
and then raj , you bring the stuff across the hall and start set up .
what if guest show up ?
entertain them .
what if they 're woman ?
stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable .
hey .
how 's it go ?
fine .
so , listen , the new art be show the revise definitive cut of blade runner .
see it .
no , you 've see the 25th anniversary final cut . this one have eight second of previously unseen footage . they say it completely change the tone of the film .
oh . pas .
come on , afterwards there 's a q & a with harrison ford 's body double .
look , i be in the halo battle of my life here , there 's this kid in copenhagen , he have no immune system so all he do be sit in his bubble and play halo _ .
ca n't you play him some other time ?
not if you believe his doctor .
oh my god , do you smell gas .
no .
yeah , no .
alright , you know they have dvd over there .
yes , but they have dvd burner over here . leonard need a dvd burner .
sheldon , a gift should n't be something someone need , it should be something fun , you know , something they would n't buy for themselves .
you mean , like a sweater ?
well , it 's a fun sweater , it 's get a bold geometric print .
be it the geometry that make it fun .
okay , the point be , one of the way we show we care about people be by put thought and imagination into the gift we give them .
okay , i see , so not a dvd burner .
exactly .
something he would n't buy for himself . something fun . something like oh , an 802.11n wireless router .
here you go , copenhagen boy , how about a taste of han christian hand grenade . come on , come on , oh you clever little . come on , come on , take that !
oh-oh . oh-oh !
what 's the matter ?
this granola bar , there 's peanut in it .
oh my god , why do you eat it ?
i do n't know , it be just there .
do n't yell at me , i 've get to go to the emergency room .
now ?
no , after my tongue have swollen to the size of a brisket .
alright , um , just , uh , let me get my key .
what do you think .
um , that one .
because of the two additional ethernet port .
sure .
he do n't need them , he 's already get a _ connect switch
oh , okay then this one .
why ?
i do n't know , the man on the box look so happy .
penny ! if i 'm go to buy leonard a gift , i 'm go to do it right . i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i do .
oh , i know i 'm go to regret this but , what trauma ?
on my twelfth birthday i really want a titanium centrifuge , so , you know , i could separate radioactive isotope .
of course .
instead of a titanium centrifuge , my parent bought me wow , this be hard . they get me a motorise dirt bike .
no ?
what twelve year old boy want a motorise dirt bike ?
all of them .
really ?
yeah .
huh ?
okay , so we 're get this one ?
yeah , i suppose .
okay , let 's go .
no , no , no , no , she do n't want that , she need a point to point peer network with a range extender .
it depends on what bus you have .
oh , dear lord .
sheldon , we have to go .
excuse me .
no , listen , see we 're throw my friend a surprise party and i 'm suppose to keep him out of his apartment for two hour .
no , see , the only way i could get him to leave be to tell him i ate a peanut . because i 'm allergic to peanut .
yes .
no , you do n't understand .
okay , i get it , i know how the world work , how about if i be to introduce you to the man who freed your people .
hey , sorry i could n't find a parking spot , how be you do .
bad , very bad .
really , ‘ co you do n't look like you 're swell up at all , maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home .
why not ?
becauth becauth-th-th . brissket , brissket ! water , need water .
alright , i 'll be right back .
penny , look , i 've get a problem .
yeah , well so do i , look you 've get to stall leonard a little longer .
okay , you have to understand something , we 're in a hospital right now .
okay , i do n't need your attitude , just hold him there a little longer .
look , i 've do my best but he want to go home and i do n't know how to stop him .
okay , how about this . you keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party i 'll point out which of my friend be easy .
do n't toy with me , woman .
okay , we do n't have that in stock , but i can special order it for you .
him .
yes , well , apparently neither do anyone else .
sheldon , we have to go .
why ?
well , for one thing , we 're late for leonard 's birthday party . and for another , i told him to call security .
good luck . by the way , a six year-old could hack your computer system .
excuse me , my friend be have an allergic reaction to peanut .
yes he be .
fank-u .
say what you will about the healthcare system in this country , but when they 're afraid of lawsuit they sure test everything .
i really do n't think the colonoscopy be necessary .
you know , before you get all swollen up , i actually thought you be try to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party .
oh , right , it 's your birthday , i have no idea it be your birthday , i completely forgot , wow , what a lousy way to spend a birthday , well it 's all over now .
there be a party , be n't there .
maybe .
howard .
be you mad ?
how could i be mad ? you actually risk your life because you care about me .
yeah , that 's why i do it .
alright . here we go . my first birthday party .
dude ! everybody left an hour ago ! surprise !
oh sweet krishna , shake it , that-a rupee maker .
i 'm so sorry you do n't get your party .
oh , it 's okay .
happy birthday anyways .
hey penny , when , uh , when 's your birthday ?
wo de zhing shi sheldon .
no , it 's wo de ming zi shi sheldon .
what 's this ?
that 's what you do . i assume a in a number of language that the gesture be part of the phrase .
well it 's not .
how be i suppose to know that ? a the teacher it 's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasy from the subject matter .
you know , i 'm really glad you decide to learn mandarin .
why ?
mai du lui tsa .
you just call leonard a syphilitic donkey .
my apology leonard , i 'm only a good a my teacher .
why be you learn chinese ?
if i be you , i 'd be more concerned by what they 're passing off a chicken .
oh , yeah , no , sure , go ahead .
what 's go on ?
oh , i 'll tell you what 's go on , that stupid self-centred bastard write about our sex life in his blog . drop dead , you stupid self-centred bastard ! thank you .
not now , i have a blog to find .
penny , be you okay ?
i 'm fine , leonard , just go away .
look , i understand that break up with someone can be very painful .
go away !
okay , feel well , bye . she do n't want to talk .
it 's smash beyond repair , what be you go to do with it ?
what else ? sell it on ebay a slightly use .
apparently he post intimate detail of their physical relationship on his blog , which i can not find anywhere .
you know what , i 'm go to go back and try talk to her again .
good idea . sit with her , hold her , comfort her , and if the moment feel right , see if you can cop a feel .
i 'm not go to do that , howard .
i 'm not aware of any social convention that require you to intervene at all .
what about “ damsel in distress ? ”
twelfth century code of chivalry , not exactly current . you 'd also have to be knight for that to apply .
i do n't care . she 's upset , i 'm go over there .
remember to sit on your hand a bit so they 're warm .
i 'm her friend , i 'm not go to take advantage of her vulnerability .
what , so you 're say that if in the depth of despair she throw herself at you and demand you take her , right there , right now , you 'll just walk away ?
i say i 'm her friend . not her gay friend .
i do n't .
sorry .
wait .
wait , do you say wait ?
tell me the truth . be i just an idiot who pick giant loser ?
no . no .
okay , so i pick good guy , but turn them into loser .
of course not .
well , it 's get to be one or the other , which be it ?
i 'm sorry , what be the choice again ?
i really thought mike be different , i thought he be sensitive and smart . i mean , not you smart , normal non-freaky smart .
yeah , no , sure .
you know , and then he just go and have to humiliate me by write about me on his blog so the entire world can read it .
actually it 's not all that easy to find .
yeah , really , well my friend at work found it , my sister found it , judging by my email a number of prisoner at the michigan state penitentiary found it .
okay , well , what exactly do this guy write , not that i need to know the detail of your sex life , i just thought . never mind .
oh god !
sandwich shop .
do n't that violate the health code ?
no , at the sub shop we be only make out .
huh . okay . but my point be that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrass .
really , do you think i overreact ?
maybe a little .
‘ cause i do that , i do overreact . maybe i should call mike and apologise .
no . no , no , that , that would be underreacting . he do break the imply confidentiality of the bedroom and , in your case , the elevator , park and fast food franchise .
yes . you 're right . i should just say i 'm do with him .
yes , you should , go ahead , say it .
but i never give the man a chance to explain .
no , you be right the first time , this be a man who love me , but in his own stupid way he be just try to show people how he feel .
no , you do well than that , you help me see it on my own .
aw , good for me . where be you go ?
i 'm go over to mike 's . leonard , thank you so much .
oh , sure . huh , maybe i be her gay friend .
howard , i 'm go to need another mandarin lesson . i obviously do n't make my point with those people .
can we please change the subject .
sure . tell u again how you screw up and get penny back together with her old boyfriend .
just roll the dice .
enslave by warlock , stay here till you roll _ , _ or _
she be mad at him . she be do with him , the relationship be broken beyond repair and i walk over there and i fix it !
boy , that story get well every time you hear it .
actually , i thought the first two rendition be far more compelling . previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character , now i just find him to be whiny and annoy .
just eat your tangerine chicken .
i 'd love to , but i do n't have tangerine chicken .
thank you so much for your stupid advice .
i 'm back .
i 'm sorry i yell at you . it 's not your fault .
well , i go over to mike 's to make up with him .
yeah , i know , i know that part .
but he have already move on .
already , that be quick .
that 's what i say to the woman who have her leg wrap around his neck .
how could he do that .
oh , well , you know , you do throw an _ gig ipod yeah , no , how could he do that .
i swear to god , i be do with guy like that . you know , macho , with the perfect body and the hair , and the money .
yeah , that must get old quick .
you know , just once , i would like to go out with someone who be nice , and honest , and who actually care about me .
what about me ?
what about if you go out with me ?
be you ask me out ?
um yes i be ask you out .
wow .
i be just go off your comment about the nice guy
no , i know , i get that . yeah , totally .
…thing and honest but , it 's no big deal
yes .
yes what ?
yes , i will go out with you .
really ?
yeah . why not , i mean , what do i have to lose ?
yeah . that 's the spirit .
show me your citrus peel . gei wo kan , ni jud di zi pei . show me your citrus peel . gei wo kan , ni jud di zi pei . show me your
aieee ya ! xia si wo le .
i 'm sorry . look , do you have a second .
a second what ? pair of underwear ?
i be just wonder if i could talk to you ? it 's about leonard .
why me ? why not koothrappali or wolowitz ?
yes , i suppose he be .
all i 'm say be , you know leonard the best .
we 're not do ?
no .
ach , why not ? we 're already through the look glass anyway .
okay , so , here 's the thing . i guess you 're aware that leonard ask me out .
well , he do n't actually say anything , but when he come back to the apartment he be do a dance that brought to mind the happy hippo in fantasia .
oh , i wish it be that simple . you see , i do n't spend much time here and so i 've never really chosen a place to sit .
well , choose .
there be a number of option and , i 'm really not familiar enough with the cushion density , air flow pattern and dispersion of sunlight to make an inform choice .
alright , why do n't you just pick one at random , and then if you do n't like it you can sit somewhere else next time .
no , no , that 's crazy . you go ahead and talk while i figure it out .
a little crush ? well i suppose so , in the same way menelaus have a little crush on helen of troy .
alright , yeah , i do n't really know who they be
well menelaus be the brother of agamemnon
yeah , i do n't care , i do n't care . the point be leonard be n't the kind of guy i usually go out with .
leonard be n't the kind of guy anyone usually go out with . would you be open to rotate the couch clockwise thirty degree ?
the last one work out well for koothrappali . he get a free ipod . oh , glare !
thank you for the clarification .
draft . you see people hear the word year and they think duration . foot pound have the same problem , that 's a unit of work , not of weight .
right , thanks .
it 's a common mistake .
not the first one i 've make today .
okay . i think this will be my seat .
sheldon , do you have anything to say that have anything to do with , you know , what i 'm talk about .
well , let 's see . we might consider schrodinger 's cat .
schrodinger ? be that the woman in 2a ?
no . that 's mr grossinger . and she do n't have a cat , she have a mexican hairless , annoy little animal , yip yip yip yip
sheldon !
well of course you do n't get it , i have n't make it yet . you 'd have to be psychic to get it , and there 's no such thing a psychic .
just like schrodinger 's cat , your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of a both good and bad . it be only by opening the box that you 'll find out which it be .
okay , so you 're say i should go out with leonard .
no , no , no , no , no , no . let me start again . in _ , erwin schrodinger
two seat right there .
chong sho sha pwe . xie xie .
i can see that . unless you 're planning on run a marathon , choose both stuff and mash potato be a starch fill redundancy .
no , it 's about penny .
a mistake involve penny ? okay , you 'll have to narrow it down .
i do n't think i can go out with her tonight .
then do n't .
other people would say “ why not ? ”
other people might be interested .
i assume you would .
now that i 'm actually about to go out with penny , i 'm not excite , i 'm nauseous .
right .
you also make a common grammatical mistake , you say nauseous when you meant nauseate . but go on .
sheldon , this date be probably my one chance with penny , what happens if i blow it .
alright , what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion ?
tell me whether or not to go through with the date .
schrodinger 's cat .
wow , that 's brilliant .
you sound surprised . mmm , hou zi shui zai li du .
hi .
hi .
come on in .
thank you . you look very nice .
thank you . so do you .
i make an eight o'clock reservation .
okay , great , listen , um , maybe we should talk first .
oh . okay . but before you say anything , have you ever heard of schrodinger 's cat ?

men do thing for woman without expect sex .
yeah , those be men who just have sex .
i 'm do this to be a good neighbour . in any case , there 's no way it could low the odds .

be you insane , you ca n't just break into a woman 's apartment in the middle of the night and clean .
i have no choice . i could n't sleep know that just outside my bedroom be our living room , and just outside our living room be that hallway , and immediately adjacent to that hallway be this .
do you realise that if penny wake up , there be no reasonable explanation a to why we 're here ?
i just give you a reasonable explanation .
no , no . you give me an explanation , it 's reasonableness will be determine by a jury of your peer .
do n't be ridiculous . i have no peer .
sheldon , we have to get out of here .
you might want to speak in a low register .
what ?
evolution have make woman sensitive to high pitch noise while they sleep , so that they 'll be rouse by a cry baby . if you want to avoid wake her , speak in a low register .
that 's ridiculous .
no , that 's ridiculous .
fine . i accept your premise , now please let 's go .
o-o-o-oh ! .
if you have time to lean , you have time to clean .
oh , what the hell .
morning .
morning .
i have to say , i slept splendidly . grant , not long , but just deeply and well .
i 'm not surprised . a well know folk cure for insomnia be to break into your neighbour 's apartment and clean .
you think ?
grant , my method may have be somewhat unorthodox , but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny 's quality of life .
you know what , you 've convince me , maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet .
you do n't think that cross a line ?
yes ! for god 's sake , sheldon , do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth .
you have a sarcasm sign ?
no , i do not have a sarcasm sign .
do you want some cereal . i 'm feel so good today i 'm go to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf . hello , honey puff .
son of a bitch !
penny 's up .
you sick , geeky bastard !
how do she know it be u ?
i may have left a suggest organisational schematic for her bedroom closet .
leonard !
god , this be go to be bad .
you come into my apartment last night when i be sleep ?
yes , but , only to clean .
really more to organise , you 're not actually dirty , per se .
i 'm very , very sorry .
do you understand how creepy this be .
oh , yes , we discuss it at length last night .
and snore . and that 's probably just a sinus infection , but it could be sleep apnoea , you might want to see an otolaryngologist . it 's a throat doctor .
and what kind of doctor remove shoe from ass ?
depend on the depth , that 's either a proctologist or a general surgeon . oh !
god !
sure , that 's another way to go .
that be n't sarcasm ?
no .
wooh , boy , you be all over the place this morning . i have a master and two phd 's , i should not have to do this .
what ?
i mean , just because most of the men i 've know in my life happen to be jerk , do n't mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon be . right ?
she ask me a question . i should probably nod .
that 's exactly what i thought . thank you for listen . you 're a doll .
oh-oh . turn your pelvis .
grab a napkin , homie . you just get serve .
it 's fine . you win .
what 's his problem ?
his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him .
be there .
really ? you ? rajesh koothrapali , spoke to penny ?
actually , i be less the chatter than the chattee .
what do she say ? be she still mad at me ?
well , she be upset at first , but , probably because her sister shot somebody . then there be something about you and then she hug me .
she hug you ? how do she hug you ? be that her perfume i smell ?
intoxicate , be n't it ?
hi .

what ?
these instruction be a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these component . this right here be why sweden have no space program .
well , uh , it look pretty good in the store .
it be an inefficient design , for example penny have a flat screen tv , which mean all the space behind it be waste .
we could put her stereo back there .
and control it how ?
run an infra-red repeater , photocell here , emitter here , easy peasy .
good point , how you gon na cool it ?
hey guy , i get this .
hang on penny . how about fan , here and here ?
also inefficient , and might be loud .
how about liquid coolant ? maybe a little aquarium pump here , run some quarter inch pvc
guy , this be actually really simple .
hold on , honey , men at work . the pvc come down here , maybe a little corrugate sheet metal a a radiator here .
oh , really , show me where we put a drip tray , a sluice and an overflow reservoir ?
guy , it 's hot in here , i think i 'll just take off all my clothes .
oh , i 've get it . how about if we replace panel a , b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium .
right , then the entire thing 's one big heat sink .
get it . .
okay , this place do look pretty good .
alright , just a few more foot , and . here we be gentleman , the gate of elzebub .

warrior , unsheathe your weapon , magic wielders raise your wand .
lock and load .
blowing the gate . control , shift , b ! oh , my god , so many goblin !
do n't just stand there , slash and move , slash and move .
stay in formation .

oooh , he 's get me .
sheldon , he 's get raj , use your sleath spell . sheldon ! sheldon !
i 've get the sword of azeroth !
forget the sword , sheldon , help raj .

goodbye , peasant .
the bastard teleport .
he 's sell the sword of azeroth on ebay .
you betrayed u for money , who be you ?
i 'm a rogue knight elf , do n't you people read character description ? wait , wait , wait , somebody just clicked “ buy it now . ”
i be the swordmaster !
wooh , i 'm all sweaty , anybody want to log on to second life and go swim , i just built a virtual pool .
no , i ca n't look at you or your avatar right now .
sound like your neighbour 's home .
excuse me .

oh no , that 's probably not such a good idea . civil servant have a document propensity to , you know , snap .
okay , well , thank you , again .
no problem . bye . oh , and , bye , bro ! .
penny for your thought .
no , i 'm fine . penny 's fine , the guy she 's kiss be really fine and
kiss , what kind of kiss ? cheek ? lip ? chaste ? french ?
what be wrong with you ?
i 'm a romantic .
please do n't tell me that your hopeless infatuation be devolve into pointless jealousy .
no , i 'm not jealous , i 'm just a little concerned for her . i do n't like the look of the guy that she be with .
because he look well than you ?
i disagree , love be not a sprint , it 's a marathon . a relentless pursuit that only end when she fall into your arm . or hit you with the pepper spray .
well , i 'm do with penny . i 'm go to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed .
like who ?
i do n't know . olivia geiger ?
the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye ?
yeah .
so ?
there be pitfall , trust me , i know . when it come to sexual harassment law i'm a bit of a self-taught expert .
look , howard , if i be to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner , i 'm not go to walk into the lab , ask her to strip naked and dance for me .
oh , then you 're probably okay .
hello lesley .
lesley i would like to propose an experiment .
right . lesley , i would like to propose an experiment .
pfff , i 've do it , about two second , _ for minestrone . anyway , i be think more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay .
i be go to characterise it a the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm , with the addition of a date-like component . but we do n't need to quibble over terminology .
heartrate , pheromone , etc , yes .
you mean , kiss you now ?
can you define the parameter of the kiss ?
thank you . . shall i count down from three ?
you propose the experiment , i think you should present your finding first .
none ?
ah . well , thank you for your time .
none at all ?
sheldon , if you be a robot , and i knew and you do n't , would you want me to tell you ?
that depends . when i learn that i 'm a robot , will i be able to handle it ?
maybe , although the history of science-fiction be not on your side .
uh , let me ask you this . when i learn that i 'm a robot , would i be bound by asimov 's three law of robotics ?
you might be bound by them right now .
that 's true . have you ever harm a human be , or through inaction allow a human be to come to harm ?
of course not .
have you ever harm yourself , or allow yourself to be harm except in case where a human be would have be endanger ?
well , no .
i smell robot .
hey , what 's go on .
the internet 's be down for half an hour .
also , sheldon may be a robot .
so , how do it go with lesley ?
oh , we try kiss , but the earth do n't move . i mean any more than the _ mile that it be go to move anyway .
i think mr tishman 's get her eye on you . i 've be there , you 're in for a treat .
oh , good lord .

if you 're compile a mix cd for a double suicide . oh , i hope that scratch post be for you .
leonard , listen to me
i 've be think about name , i 'm kind of torn between einstein , newton and sergeant fuzzyboots .
leonard , do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically alter cat ?
maybe , if it 's a cute little cuddly cat .
oh , come on , leonard ! this be obviously about penny .
it do n't matter . the woman 's not interested in me , the woman reject me .
no . no , now that be not my point . my point be , do n't buy a cat .
no , but you 're right . i should march over there and ask her out .
oh , goody , we 're get a cat .
good afternoon penny , so hi , hey . uh i be wonder if you have plan for dinner .
uh , do you mean dinner tonight ?
there be an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner . technically it refers to the large meal of the day whenever it be consume , so , to clarify here , by dinner i mean supper .
or dinner . i be think six thirty , if you can go , or a different time .
uh , six thirty 's great .
really ? great !
yeah , i like hang out with you guy .

no . the dark crescent-shaped pattern under your arm conceal it nicely . what time be your date ?
six thirty .
perfect , that give you two hour and fifteen minute for that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate .
be it too much ?
not if you 're a rugby team .
by the way , if it should ever come up , you do n't join u because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos .
why would i join you ?
no reason . oh , you know what , maybe this be n't such a good idea .
oh , no , no , no , well now , there 's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic even .
if i could of , i would of .
i 'm have a panic attack .
if i could calm down i would n't be have a panic attack , that 's why they call it a panic attack .

right . sorry .
here come our new bos , be polite .
howard wolowitz .
an actual real scientist . how be that ?
i ca n't believe he fire me .
well , you do call him a glorify high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment be light his own fart .
in my defence , i preface that by say “ with all due respect . ”
morning
morning .
you 're make egg for breakfast ?
this be n't breakfast , it 's an experiment .
huh ? co it look a lot like breakfast .
i finally have the time to test my hypothesis , about the separation of the water molecule from the egg protein , and it impact vis-a-vis taste .

what do you want , mom ?
yeah .
what for ?
no .
i 'm not go to apologise , i do n't say anything that be n't true .

no you do n't . oh , hey , what 's sheldon suppose to be .
oh , he 's the doppler effect .

okay .
see , people get it .
mmmm , by odin 's beard , this be good chex mix .
no thanks , peanut , i ca n't afford to swell up in these tights .
i 'm confuse . if there 's no costume parade , what be we do here ?
we 're socialise . meeting new people .
telepathically ?
oh hey , when do you get here , hi !
penny be wear the bad catwoman costume i have ever see , and that include halle berry 's .
she 's not catwoman , she 's just a generic cat .
and that 's the kind of sloppy costume which result from a lack of rule and competition .
hey guy , check out the sexy nurse . i believe it 's time for me to turn my head and cough .
what be your move ?
i 'm go to use the mirror technique . she brush her hair back , i brush my hair back , she shrug , i shrug , subconsciously she 's think we 're in sync , we belong together .
where do you get this stuff ?
you know , psychology journal , internet research , and there 's this great show on vh about how to pick up girl .
oh , if only i have his confidence . i have such difficulty speak to woman . or around woman . or at time , even effeminate men .
if that 's a work stethoscope , maybe you 'd like to hear my heart skip a beat .
no , seriously , you can , i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia .
i want to get to know penny 's friend , i just , i do n't know how to talk to these people .
well , i actually might be able to help .
how so ?
go on .
well , it seem that the newcomer approach the exist group with the greet “ how waste be i ? ” which be met with an approve chorus of “ dude . ”
that 's a far a i 've gotten .
this be ridiculous , i 'm jumping in .
good luck .
no , you 're come with me .
oh , i hardly think so .
come on .
yes . but i need a wing-man .
alright , but if we 're go to use flight metaphor i 'm much more suit to be the guy from the faa , analyse wreckage .
hi .
hello .
me ? i 'll give you a hint . neeeeooooowwwww !
close ! neeeeeoooooowwwww !
neeeeeooooowwwwww !
i 'm the doppler effect .
why do n't you just tell people you 're a zebra ?
well , why do n't you just tell people you 're one of the seven dwarf .
because i 'm frodo .
yes , well , i 'm the doppler effect .
oh no .
that 's penny 's ex-boyfriend .
what do you suppose he 's do here ? besides disrupt the local gravity field .
if he be any big , he 'd have moon orbit him .
oh , snap . so i guess we 'll be leave now .
why should we leave ? for all we know , he crashed the party and penny do n't even want him here . .
you have a back-up hypothesis .
maybe they just want to be friend .
or maybe she want to be friend , and he want something more .
yes , but you 're much closer to it than he be .
look , if this be _ year ago , by virtue of his size and strength , kurt would be entitle to his choice of female partner .
and male partner . animal partner . large primordial eggplant , pretty much whatever tickle his fancy .
yes , but our society have undergone a paradigm shift , in the information age , sheldon , you and i be the alpha male . we should n't have to back down .
true . why do n't you text him that and see if he back down ?
no . i 'm go to assert my dominance face to face .
face to face ? be you go to wait for him to sit down , or be you go to stand on a coffee table ?
hello penny . hello kurt .
oh , hey guy . you have a good time ?
give the reaction to my costume , this party be a scathing indictment of the american education system .
no , i 'm a hobbit .
uh , a hobbit be a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth , whereas an elf be an immortal tall warrior .
because he be neither tall nor immortal , and none of u could be the flash .
i think we 're all talk to penny here .
i 'm not . no offence .
alright kurt , be nice .
kurt !
okay , i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me . i mean , you ca n't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you 're driven to animalistic puffery .
no , i say animalistic . of course we 're all animal , but some of u have climbed a little high on the evolutionary tree .
you 're in trouble .
okay , kurt , please .
a homo-habilus discover his opposable thumb say what ?
i think i 've make my point .
let me remind you , while my moral support be absolute , in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless .
there 's not go to be a confrontation , in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation .
kurt , put him down this instant .
i do n't care , i 'm finish it , put him down .
he 's a hobbit ! i 've get your back .
leonard , be you okay .
yeah , no , i 'm fine . it 's good , it 's a good party , thanks for have u , it 's just get a little late so .

if we 're all through play mock the flaw technology , can we get on with halo night , we be suppose to start at eight , it be now _ .
so ? we 'll start now .
yes , first we have to decide if those lose six minute will be come out of game time , bathroom time or the pizza break .
we can split it two , two and two .
if we 're have anchovy on the pizza we ca n't take it out of bathroom time .
oh , what fresh hell be this ?
see a penny , pick her up , and all the day you 'll have good luck .
no you wo n't . uh , can i hide out here for a while .
he really need to dial it down .
so , if you do n't like this christie , why be you let her stay ?
well , she be engage to my cousin while she be sleep with my brother , so she 's kind of family .
you know , i apologise for my earlier outburst , who need halo when we can be regale with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha ?
oh , i do n't think she 's a whore .
no , yeah she 's definitely a whore . i mean , she have absolutely no standard , this one time , she be at where 's howard ?
bonjour mademoiselle , i understand you 're new in town .
oh good grief .
ugh , i can not believe christie let howard into my apartment .
and i can not believe people pay for horoscope , but on a more serious note it 's _ and we 're still not play halo .
okay , fine , we 'll just play one on one until he get back .
well the only way we can play team at this point be if we cut raj in half .
oh , sure , cut the foreigner in half , there 's a billion more where he come from .
hey , if you guy need a fourth , i 'll play .
great idea .
uh , no . the wheel be a great idea . relativity be a great idea . this be a notion , and a rather sucky one at that .
why ?
why ? oh , penny , penny , penny .
oh , what , what , what ?
this be a complex battle simulation with a steep learn curve , there be myriad weapon , vehicle and strategy to master , not to mention an extremely intricate back-story .
oh cool , whose head do i just blow off ?
mine .
okay , i get this , lock and load boy .
it 's the only way we can play team .
yes , but whoever 's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh .
okay , this be n't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who 's just respawned , you need to give them a chance to now come on !
raj , raj , she 's get me corner , cover me .
cover this , sucker . ha-ha-ha !
penny , you be on fire .
yeah , so be sheldon .
okay , that 's it , i do n't know how , but she be cheat . no-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game .
wait , wait , sheldon , come back , you forgot something .
what ?
this plasma grenade . ha ! look , it 's rain you !
gosh , he 's kind of a sore loser , be n't he ?
well , to be fair , he be also a rather unpleasant winner .
well , it 's be fun .
you know , penny , we make such a good team , maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournament sometime .
or we could just have a life .
i guess for you that 's an option .
good night , leonard .
good night .
a usual , nice talk to you raj
what do you suppose she meant by that ?
she 's an enigma , raj .
and another thing , there 's a certain ethic to the game , penny , a well estab
she 's go , sheldon .
well she could have say goodbye .
okay , i have a problem .
it 's call carpal tunnel syndrome , and quite frankly you deserve it .
what 's wrong ?
um , well , howard and christie be kind of hook up in my bedroom .
be you sure ?
no , take the couch , or my bed , i just get new pillow , hypo-allergenics .

hold that thought , leonard , a moment .
let me guess , you have a problem with this .
where do i begin ?
it 's up to you , crazy person 's choice .
well first , we do n't have house guest , frankly if i could afford the rent i 'd ask you to leave .
your friendship mean a lot to me a well , what else ?
so ?
so , if there be an earthquake and the three of u be trap here , we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon .
i 'm sorry , be you suggest that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism ?
no-one ever think it will happen until it do .
penny , if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bone while we sleep , you can stay .
hu what ?
he 's engage in reductio-ad-absurdum . it 's the logical fallacy of extend someone 's argument to ridiculous proportion and then criticise the result , and i do not appreciate it .
i 'll get you a blanket and a pillow .
okay , well since i 'm obviously be ignore here , let 's go over the morning schedule , i use the bathroom from _ to _ , plan your ablution and bodily function accordingly .
how be i suppose to plan my bodily function ?
i suggest no liquid after 11pm .
here you go .
thanks leonard .
hmmph , wrong .
i 'm listen .
your head go on the other end .
it 's culturally universal , a bed , even a temporary bed , be always orient with the headboard away from the door . it serf the ancient imperative of protect oneself against marauder .
i 'll risk it .
hm !
anything else i should know .
yes . if you use my toothbrush i 'll jump out that window . please do n't come to my funeral . have a good night .
sorry about that .
that 's okay .
fyi , his toothbrush be the red one in the plexiglas case under the uv light .

every saturday since we have live in this apartment , i have awaken at _ , pour myself a bowl of cereal .
i know , i know , look , you have a tv in your room , why do n't you just have breakfast in bed ?

ah , well then we 'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection .
in here my lady .
chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
well there 's one beloved child 's book i 'll never read again .
leonard .
i 'm sheldon .
uh , so christie , what be your plan ?
yeah , no , i meant plan to find some place to live . other than with me , not that i do n't love have you , but it's a little crowd .
penny , you 're always welcome to stay with u .
oh , terrific , now we 're run a cute little b & b .
let me offer a little outside the box think here , why do n't christie stay with me .
for one thing you live with your mother .
i do not , my mother life with me .
no more talk , everybody go .
so , what do you say , you wan na repair to castle wolowitz ?
i 'm sorry , i should have mention this earlier , my last name be wolowitz .
i imagine there be n't many kosher corn-huskers .
anything you want .
when they perfect human clone i 'm go to order twelve of those .
howard , ca n't you see she 's use you ?
who care , last night she pull off her blouse and i wept !
really ?
yeah .
yay ! if you 'll excuse me , i have some bar-mizvah bond to cash .
i 'm sorry , we can not do this without wolowitz .
we ca n't order chinese food without wolowitz ?
let me walk you through it , our standard be , the steam dumpling appetizer , general so 's chicken , beef with broccoli , shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main . do you see the problem ?
i see a problem .
so , we 'll just order three entree .
we could cut it into third .
then it be no longer a dumpling , once you cut it open it be at best a very small open face sandwich .
he 's put his need ahead of the collective good . where he come from , that 's punishable by death .
can we get an order of dumpling , but with three instead of four .
fine , bring u three order of dumpling , that 's twelve , we 'll each have four .
that work .
no , if we fill up on dumpling we 'll need to eliminate another entree .
if we have extra , we 'll just take the leftover home .
and divide it how , i 'm tell you we can not do this without wolowitz .
wolowitz be with his new girlfriend , if you have let me invite penny then you would have have your fourth .
have you see penny eat chinese food , she us a fork , and she double dip her egg roll .
we do n't order egg roll .
exactly , but we 'd have to if she be here .
can we please make a decision , not only be there child starve in india , there 's an indian starve right here .
here 's an idea , why do n't we just go out for indian food .
no .
how about soup ?
yeah , we can always divide soup .
what about the won-tons ?
oh , hey guy , what 's up ?
yeah . okay . so ?
well , with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christie ,
she 's not my friend . friend do not get their friend care bear all sweaty .
right , anyway , uh , with wolowitz occupy elsewhere , we have something we want to ask you . sheldon ?
yes . penny , we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team . i do n't think i need to tell you what an honour this be .
oh , that 's so sweet . but i 'm go out dance with a girlfriend .
you ca n't go out , it 's halo night .
well , for penny it 's dance night .
you go dance every wednesday .
no .
then it 's not dance night .
look , why do n't i play with you guy tomorrow ?
tonight be halo night , it 's like talk to a wall .
alright , now sheldon , you and i be about to have a problem .
sheldon , remember , we role-played this .
yes , but you do n't portray her a completely irrational .
alright fella , i get ta go . good luck .
maybe we should have ask if we could go dance with her and her girlfriend .
okay , assume we could dance , which we ca n't , there be three of u and two of them .
so ?
it 's the chinese restaurant all over again . i assure you that cut a dumpling in third be child 's play compare with three men , each attempt to dance with _ % of a woman .
aaah , for god 's sake , sheldon , you be drive me crazy .
your anger 's not with me , sir , but with basic mathematics .
no , i 'm pretty sure my anger 's with you .
what 's happen to u ? we 're fall apart .
who be you call ?
the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe .
hi this be howard wolowitz .
no , i 'm just kid , i 'll re-record it .
sheldon , think this through , you 're go to ask howard to choose between sex and halo .
no , i 'm go to ask him to choose between sex and halo _ . a far a i know , sex have not be upgraded to include high-def graphic and enhance weapon system .
you 're right , all sex have be nudity , orgasm and human contact .
my point .
shut up howard .
you girl 's talk , i 'm go to take my scooter out for a little spin .
why do n't you stop butting in where you do n't belong .
what be you guy do here ?
it 's halo night .
he 's not a man , he 's a putz , and do n't you take that tone with me , you gold digger .
you heard me , and i 'll tell you something else , you 're barking up the wrong tree , co a long a you 're around , howard be out of the will .
that 's right , go back to babylon , you whore .
i thought she be the whore of omaha ?
shhh !
sheldon , you get him in your sight , fire , he 's charge his plasma rifle .
i ca n't shoot now , i 'm cloak .

that 's why the call it cloak , dead man .
well then start throw grenade .
i 'm all out .
hi guy , my friend and i get tire of dance , so we come over to have sex with you .
that will do , raj , straight for the tank .
we say no tank .
there be no rule in hell !
son of a bitch , medpack , i need a medpack !
there 's a sniper , use your rocket launcher .
and now you 're out of life . why do you hit pause ?

and this be leonard and sheldon 's apartment .
guess whose parent just get broadband .
may i present , live from new delhi , dr and mr v m koothrappali .
hi .
sorry papa .
and over here be sheldon .
he life with leonard .
no , no , not like haroun and tanweer .
yeah , we 're not like haroun and tanweer !
papa , please do n't start .
okay , that 's my life , that 's my friend , good to see you , say goodbye .
what be it papa .
be it just me , or do webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless .
the little fat girl that use to kick me in the samosa and call me untouchable .
why do you do that ?
but papa , i 'm not suppose
spring wedding ?
if you do n't want to meddle , then why be you meddling .
if i may , your parent probably do n't consider this meddling , while arrange marriage be no longer the norm , indian parent continue to have a great than average involvement in their child 's life .
why be you tell me about my own culture ?
you seem confuse .
sorry , mommy , papa , but with all due respect i really ca n't go through
i do n't believe it .
neither do i doogie howser 's be off the air for like , twenty year .
actually , i read somewhere that it 's one of the most popular programme in india .
it might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one 's child enter the medical profession .
i bet you 're right .
i bet they love scrub .
excuse me , hello ? my parent be try to marry me off to a total stranger , what be i go to do ?
i suggest you go through with it .
what ?
romantic love a the basis for marriage have only exist since the nineteenth century . up until then , arrange marriage be the norm , and it serve society quite well .
it 's the entire premise of fiddler on the roof .
i 'm not a big fan of musical , but i love that show .
me too . of course , it speaks to me culturally .
understandable , but there 's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity .
let 's not forget it 's get some really catchy tune .
what ?
find new friend .

i do n't want to be in a jar . i want my brain in an android body . eight foot tall and ripped .
i 'm with you . i just have to make sure if i 'm a synthetic human i 'd still be jewish . i promise my mother .
i suppose you could have your android penis circumcise . but that 's something your rabbi would have to discus with the manufacturer .
not to mention you 'd have to power down on saturday .
sheldon , why be this letter in the trash ?
well , there 's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously form around the letter , but occam 's razor would suggest that someone threw it out .
it 's from the institute for experimental physic . they want u to present our paper on the property of super solid at the topical conference on bowes-einstein condensate .
i know . i read it before i threw it out .
okay if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question , why do you throw it out .
forget the party .
forget the party ? what a nerd .
be there any other honour i 've gotten that i do n't know about ? do ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it ?
leonard , please do n't take this the wrong way , but the day you win a nobel prize , be the day i begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on fly carpet .
hoo-hoo-hoo . the only thing miss from that insult be “ yo mamma . ”
i 've get one , hey leonard , your mamma 's research methodology be so flaw .
shut up , howard . sheldon , we have to do this .
no we do n't . we have to take in nourishment , expel waste , and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from die , everything else be optional .
okay , let me put it this way , i 'm do it .
you ca n't . i 'm the lead author .
oh , come on . the only reason you 're the lead author be because we go alphabetically .
it do n't need prove .
so the entire scientific community be just suppose to take your word ?
they 're not suppose to , but they should .
alright , i do n't care what you say , i 'm go to the conference and i 'm present our finding .
and i forbid it .
you forbid it ?
if i 'm not take credit for our work then nobody be .
oh , you admit that it 's our work .
no , once again , i 'm throw you a bone . and once again , you be welcome .

so , you know , be n't there maybe some way you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing .

what be this ?
oh , why do n't you wear it at halloween ?
because it 's not a costume , it 's a flight suit .
okay , alright , move on , oh , wow , a paisley shirt .

i do n't understand the question .
well i 'm just ask if it 's difficult to be fight with your best friend .
oh . i have n't thought about it like that . i wonder if i 've be experience physiological manifestation of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil .
wait what ?
i could n't poop this morning .
you should just talk to him , i 'm sure you guy can work this out .
it 's certainly preferable to my plan .

be that all ?
all ? in particle physic , twenty five be woodstock .
oh , well , then good !
i be n't expect such a crowd , i 'm a little nervous .
it 's okay , just open with a joke , you 'll be fine .
let 's roll . hey , nice suit .

i really should have brought my own car .
any other question ?
oh , i see , be the apple fall on newton 's head , be that just an anecdote ?
you be not isaac newton .
no , no that 's true , gravity would have be apparent to me without the apple .
you can not possibly be that arrogant .
you continue to underestimate me , my good man .

okay , that be it .
you can not blow up my head with your mind .
then i 'll settle for an aneurysm .

you be try to blow up my head .
so it be work .
it be n't , it be not , you be a nutcase .
oh we 'll see about that , head up you people in the front row , this be a splash zone .
stop , stop it , quit it .
more often than you 'd think .
vulcan nerve pinch !
you could have offer me a ride home .
you 're lucky i do n't run you over .
i really do n't understand what you 're so unhappy about , you beg me to come , i come , there 's just no please you .
you 're right , i 'm the problem , i 'm the one that need help .
well that 's not much of an apology , but i 'll take it .
excuse me . be there anything you 'd like to apologise for ?
yes . i 'm sorry i try to blow up your head . it be uncalled for .
you wo n't believe this .
somebody get the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube .

that would be me . hey , check it out , it 's a feature video . .
oh jeez . be this suit really look that bad ?
forget your suit , look at my arm wave , i 'm like a flamingo on ritalin .
howard , would you like to explain to me why your facebook page have a picture of me sleep on your shoulder caption “ me and my girlfriend ? ”
uh-oh , here come “ the talk . ”
it 's also not pink and have no berry .

what be you do ?
i do n't feel a draft .
why do n't we just go into your .

that might work too .
goodnight leonard .
he 's come . screen saver .
oh , hey , leonard , how be your date ?
bite me . sheldon , how could you just sit there and let them spy on me ?
you should thank u . when future generation try to determine why your relationship with penny crashed and burn , this right here be the black box .
what be you talk about , the date go fine .
dude , she say she want to slow thing down .
okay , so , she say she want to slow thing down . it 's like say “ i 'm really enjoy this meal , i 'm go to slow down and savour it . ”
you be the fish .
i 'm not the fish .
oh really , do you make a second date .
well , we sort of decide to wing it .
oh , even i know that 's lame .
okay , alright , let 's assume your hypothesis . we go to dinner , we talk , we laugh , we kiss , where could i have possibly go wrong .
they also do n't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate . sadly , that 's my home run swing .
look , everything go fine . i do n't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starter . the woman across the hall be into me .
let 's go to the tape . look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss , no change in respiration , pupil un-dilated , no flush of the chest .
interest , her jaw be clenched , no tongue access , clearly a bad sign amongst mating human .
that 's not a bad sign .
please , you might a well have be two iguana with no dewlap enlargement .
and the bad sign of all be , you 're here and not there .
i 'm not there because i 'm take thing slow . which , by the way , compare to you guy approach warp speed . and take down that camera .
he be a lot more fun when he have no hope .
give him time .
hi .
oh , good lord . why do n't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock ?
sheldon , may i ask you a question ?
i would prefer that you not , but i wo n't go so far a to forbid it .
well i assume you 're not refer to digestive regularity ? because i 've come to learn that such inquiry be inappropriate .
oh . well , a few year ago he do go out with a woman who have a phd in french literature .
how be that not a braniac ?
well , for one thing , she be french . for another , it be literature .
so , do you think that if leonard and i keep date he 'll eventually get bore with me .
that depends .
on what ?
do you have a work knowledge of quantum physic ?
no .
no .
do you know any card trick ?
okay , okay , you know , i get it , leonard have no business be involve with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lie to him about finish community college .
why would you lie about that ?
well , he be go on and on about this college and that grad school and i do n't want him to think i be some stupid loser .
you thought the opposite of stupid loser be community college graduate ?
you know , there be a lot of successful people in this country who be community college graduate .
yeah , but you be neither .
you 're ask me to keep a secret ?
yeah .
physiologically impossible .
oh sheldon , please , look , i 'm ask you a a friend .
so you 're say that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidence ?
well , yeah .
interest . see , one more question , and perhaps i should have lead with this , when do we become friend ?
you could be batman ?
sure . i 'm batman . see .
hi guy .
hey .
hi penny .
hey , penny , if you 're not do anything friday night i thought maybe we could go and see a movie .

what about saturday ?
you know , i 'm not sure , the manager have n't post the schedule yet , how about i let you know .
great . so you just let me know when you know . so oh god , i be the bad fish ! what do i do wrong ?
why be you ask me , i have no information about your interaction with penny other than what you provide me , nor do i have any method of learn such thing .
what do that mean ?
nothing . you seem to be imply an informational back channel between me and penny where obviously none exists .
i just think you need to be careful how you phrase thing , sir .
what 's go on with you ?
there 's no reason to bring my look into this . good day , leonard .
what ?
i say good day !
good day ?
also today we have a fresh caught alaska salmon , and that 's serve with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice . our soup of the day
you must release me from my oath .
sheldon , i 'm work .

leonard , i 'm move out .
what do you mean , you 're move out ? why ?
there do n't have to be a reason .
yeah , there kind of do .

hey , qu'est q'wass up ?
we just get back from that exhibit of those plasticise human cadaver .
and some of those skinless chick be hot .
if you 'll excuse me , i 'm go to pack .
that 's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia .
it 's not you , howard , he say he 's move out .
what do you do ? do you change the contrast or brightness setting on the television ?
no .
do you take a band aid off in front of him ?
no .
do you buy generic ketchup , forget to rinse the sink , talk to him through the bathroom door ?
no .
do you make fun of train ?
i do n't do anything , he 's just go insane .
well , we all knew this day be come .

i ca n't believe i do n't bring my gieger counter . you know , i have it on my bed and i do n't pack it .
well , if you 're not comfortable stay here , sheldon
i 'm kid , i packed it . it be a joke , i be subvert the conversational expectation . i believe they call that the , um , old switcheroo .
terrific .
be that woman aishwarya rai ?
yes , be n't she an amaze actress .
how dare you . aishwarya rai be a goddess . by comparison madhuri dixit be a leprous prostitute .
sorry , i do n't mean to offend you . obviously you 're not that familiar with indian cinema .
who be it ?
tag . you 're it .
should n't you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire ?
i 've never slept on an air mattress before . no lumbar support whatsoever .
maybe you 'd be happier on a park bench ?
i do n't see any way to get a park bench in here .
do you want to switch ?
no , that 's fine . i 'm perfectly comfortable sleep on a bouncy castle .
get out of bed , we 're switch .
what 's go on ? be you boy roughhouse ?

hi .
yeah , hi , listen , i know what 's be bother you about u , and i have the answer .
what be you talk about .
first i want to say that it 's not sheldon 's fault , he try very hard to keep your secret , if howard have n't drug him he would have take it to his grave .
he told you ?
yes , but it 's okay . now that we know what the problem be , there 's a simple solution .
a place for fun , a place for knowledge . see , this man here 's play hacky sack , and this girl 's go to be a paralegal .
well , it 's really not that fancy , it 's just a city college .
right , but i have to have some sort of degree to date you ?
that do n't matter to me at all .
so , it 's fine with you if i 'm not smart .
absolutely . okay , this time i know where i go wrong . oh bite me !
me , too .
be it a high-frequency whistle ?
no , it 's more of a relentless , narcissistic drone .
then it must be a tumour .
maybe it 's a linger bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies .
be that possible ? i use to get those all the time . even in church .
it 's not enough that she mock me , but that be n't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot .
do you understand that stephanie 's not here to treat your imaginary ailment ?
how be it imaginary that i keep hearing an octave above middle c ? be that imaginary ? i do n't think so .

uh , sweetie , sweetie , dave be talk . you know , i love science .
since when ?
since always . call me a geek , but i be just nut for the whole subatomic particle thing .
ha . well , that 's what i be , queen of the nerd .
you know , i have always want to see a big science lab .
since when ?
since always .
uh , yeah . i guess .
um , yeah , yeah , that sound great , let me just get my jacket .

how about the toaster oven ?
what do the toaster oven ever do to you ?
yeah , this be an auspicious moment . yeah , like robert oppenheimer or neil armstrong , we need the appropriate word to mark this historic scientific event .
how about “ die , toaster , die ” ?

yeah , come on in . what 's up ?
i need you to apologize to how

we do n't have that option , we 've accepted the challenge . we ca n't run away from a fight .
oh , please , we 've spent our whole life run away from fight . personally , i can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size .
impressive a that may be , monte be not u . monte have no fear .
you be overlook the fact that we now know what we 're up against and we can modify monte so that he 's prepared .
you want to prepare him ? install a bladder and a pair of short so he can wet himself .
excuse me , but how be we go to make any modification without wolowitz ? have you heard from penny yet ?
have faith , gentleman . we do n't need wolowitz , engineering be merely the slow young brother of physic . watch and learn . do either of you know how to open the toolbox ?
marcy grossman be sunshine , on a cloudy day , when it 's cold outside , marcy grossman be the month of may
oh , it 's cute

i do n't know .
nice little bot you 've get here .
what 's this do , spin ?
neat . good work . sheldon , we 've get to call this off .
but , sheldon , we do n't have a chance . the only improvement you be able to make on the robot be to put fresh battery in the remote .
that 's not overconfidence , that 's observation .
he 's right , leonard . the paradigm be to the death .
never . i 'd rather see monte dead than in your hand .
do it .
come on , sheldon , you get this .
run , monte , run !
go , monte ! go monte !
go , go , go , go !
do n't hurt u , do n't hurt u ,
well , so much for make up for the emotional wound of childhood .
i do this . monte be kill by my hubris and my pride . no matter what anybody say , this be my fault .
no one 's argue with you , dude .
i get your text . how bad be oy .
forget the robot . what happen to you ?
he slip and fell .
yes , i slip and fell . in the bathroom . bounce right off the tub .
yes , now he know what bathtub be capable of do when you do n't treat them with respect .
yeah . they sucker punch you when your eye be close .
so what do you think , howard ? it 's not that bad , right ?
oh , no . a little electrical tape , some solder . be you insane ? i 've see space probe that crashed into the desert that be in well shape than this .
you 're right . monte 's go . we 'll bury him in the morning . a simple ceremony . i 'll speak . leonard , you 'll play your cello .
sheldon , honey , be n't you get a little carry away ? i mean , it 's just a toy robot .
just a toy robot ?
penny .
i know , i get it . sheldon , i 'm sorry .
well , do n't get the wrong idea . the way i see it , i 'm halfway to pity sex .
mmm , gentleman , i put it to you , the bad tapioca pudding be well than the best pudding of any other flavour .
first off , that be axiomatically wrong , because the best pudding be chocolate . secondly , the organic structure of tapioca make it a jiggling bowl of potential death . it be extract from the plant
hey , i 'm think of grow a mustache .
ah , no kid ! a fu man chu ? a handlebar pencil ?
it be extract from the plant
i 'm not sure yet . you know , george clooney have one now !
really ? i once saw him shopping at ralph 's . he be buying tequila .
oh , you 'd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey .
alright this be cruel , we well let him finish before his head explodes .
tapioca be extract from the root of the plant manihot esculenta . due to a high concentration of cyanide it be poisonous in it raw form and lethal if prepared improperly .
feel well now ?
it be also indigenous to brazil , a be the cocoa bean , from which we get chocolate , the best pudding . and you promise you would n't do that anymore !
hey kripke .
what a jerk .
do n't feel bad leonard , negative result be still result .
alright , please do n't cheer me up anymore .
c'mon , do n't let him get to you . it 's kripke .
yeah , he 's a ginormous knob .
fo ' shizzle .
well then , the solution be simple . i shall befriend him . kripke !
what 'd you say of the idea of you and i become friend ?
really ? that seem rather short sight , come from someone who be generally consider altogether unlikable . why do n't you take some time to reconsider ?
well i think we 're off to a terrific start .
there you go . now any e-mail from wolowitz will go right into your spam folder .
thanks ! i mean the e-mail do n't bother me a much a the vacation picture of him in a bathing suit .
yeah , i get the same one . and that 's not a bathing suit , it 's a tan line .
oh he 's try to make a new friend .
oh really ? well , good for him .
well , how do you guy become friend ?
there be a flier on the bulletin board at the university . roommate want . whistler need not apply .
and you move in anyway ?
i assume he be joking . you 'd be surprised how many particle physicist have a whimsical side .
well , what about howard and raj , i mean how do you become friend with them ?
i do n't know , how do carbon atom form a benzene ring ? proximity and valence electron .
i suppose . i do miss whistle though .
oh come on , really ?
first warn .
penny penny penny.this be for you .
hello sheldon .
what be this ?
it 's a questionnaire i devise . i 'm have some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work , so i 'm do a little research to well understand why my current friend like me .
yes . well , that be a good question . but be this really the best way to figure it out ?
yeah , i agree , the social science be largely hokum . but , short of put electrode in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship , this be the best i can do .
okay , question _ . rank the follow aspect of sheldon cooper in order of appeal . intelligence . ruthless attention to hygiene . playfulness . java applet write ?
only _ . do n't worry , in deference to you , i 've kept them on a high school graduate reading level .
thanks pal .
sheldon honey , do you ever consider make friend by be , i do n't know , pleasant ?
your questionnaire , very disappoint .
i answer every question sheldon .
you answer the multiple choice question in a pattern . a b b a c a b b a c .
aw , you picked up on that huh ?
how could i not ?
come on ! there 's over _ question . and look at some of these thing . sheldon be to camaraderie , a the space shuttle be to blank ?
yes , well it 's well than what wolowitz do . he drew a raccoon with what appear to be , a distend scrotum .
it 's kinda cute , until you get to the scrotum .
what hope do i have for establish new relationship give that my current friend apparently can not take a few hour out of their life to help me ?
sheldon , i 'm not go to defend a big-balled raccoon .
what i 'm try to say be that , maybe you ca n't approach this a a purely intellectual exercise .
what do you mean ! ?
well , remember when you try to learn how to swim use the internet ?
i do learn how to swim .
on the floor .
the skill be transferrable . i just have no interest in go in the water .
then why learn how to swim ?
where be we go ?
you 're drive me to the mall . i 'm go to acquire a book that summarizes the current theory in the field of friendmaking .
why do n't you just lie down on the floor and swim there ?
cop with the death of a love one . my condolence .
too bad . if it 'd be a friend , i 'm available to fill the void . it 's just a well , she smell like moth ball .
okay , if you 're gon na start sniff people , i 'm gon na go get a hot pretzel .
excuse me . do you have any book about make friend ?
i assume the skill can be extrapolate and transfer .
oh ! i love train !
me too ! most people do n't see it . what be you reading ?
oh i do like monkey !
somewhat anthropomorphize but yes . say , maybe sometime you and i can go see monkey together . would you like that ?
i 'm make friend with this little girl . what 's your name ?
hi rebecca , i 'm your new friend , sheldon .
no you 're not , let 's go .
do n't look up , there 's camera .
i 'm curious . in the “ how well do you know sheldon ” section , what do you put for his favourite amino acid ?
lysine .
damn it . i have lysine and change it .
oh good ! you 're just in time . i believe i 've isolated the algorithm for make friend .
hear him out . if he 's really on to something , we can open a booth at comic-con , make a fortune .
see , my initial approach to kripke , have the same deficiency a those that plague stu the cockatoo , when he be new at the zoo .
stu the cockatoo ?
it 's a terrific book . i 've distil it essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process .
have you thought about put him in a crate while you 're out of the apartment ?
i can fix it .
this appear significantly more monolithic than it do on my laptop . no , one expect to see hominid learn to use bone a weapeons .
little kid hominid , perhaps . be this your entire job ? your parent must be so proud .
i be ? i be wrong . it be a fear of height .
not really . i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that 's approach an asymptote .
what part of an inverse tangent function approach an asymptote do you not understand ?
yeah , i do n't think i can .
no , that do n't seem any more likely .
well , it 's not exactly a plan but i think i 'm go to pas out .
i 'm sorry . can we please just do it one more time ?
okay . _ , _ , _ , _ , _ and
it 's a little thing but you really do miss it .
hello , everyone . i brought my new friend , barry kripke , home for dinner .
how be rock climb ?
d-d-d ! that 's where i sit .
how much time you get ?
want some chinese food ?
in the bathroom .
sheldon , be you okay ?
oh yes , i pas out all the time . but , it be worth it . i 've make substantial progress in bonding with kripke , which brings me to an awkward moment .
what 's that ?
maintain five friendship promise to be a herculean task . so , i 'm go to have to let one of you go .
me , me . let it be me .
can i whistle ?
do n't be silly . howard , you do not have a phd , your cologne be an assault on the sens and you 're not available for video game during the jewish high holiday .
guilty a charge . i 'm out .
no . you , too , be safe .
oh come on . what do i have to do ?
okay . you know what ? i see where this be go . i 'm not one of you guy . i 'm not a scientist . so just
yeah . shoulda , woulda coulda , raj .
eww .
penny .
so uh , kripke , i be wonder if there 's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer .
no ? but we 're friend !
i 'm confuse . i be give an understand that you allow your friend time on the machine ?
oh . this entire endeavour seem to have be an exercise in futility . raj , you 're back in . he like monkey .
you get ta give him credit for stick with it .
i do n't think he have it in him .
hmmm .
the problem appear to be unsolvable .
maybe you could run some computer simulation .
we 've get to be miss something . let 's start again . the movie be play here at _ , here at _ , here at _ and here at _ .
why ? they 're state-of-the-art digital projection , 20-channel surround sound .
yes , but they have no icee machine . despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign , i might add .
what about the multiplex here ? the seat be terrific .
they have twizzlers instead of red vine . no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that .
well , it 's gon na take at least an hour to eat , and i do n't see a sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a sheldon-approved theatre .
unacceptable , the delay would result in tomorrow morning 's bowel movement occur at work .
hang on , hang on . there 's a 7-eleven here . we smuggle slurpies , which be essentially icees , in under our coat , after have a pleasant meal either here , here or here .
wow . i do n't see how we miss that .
excuse me , in what universe be slurpies icees ?
that 's how we miss it .
sheldon , would you be prepared , on a non-precedential basis , to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpie-icee equivalency ?
oh , leonard , you know i ca n't do that .
okay , i guess we only have one option .
yep , i do n't see any way around it .
bye , sheldon .
see ya .
later , dude .
they 're right , it be the only option .
ooh , ooh , shut the door , shut the door .
why ?
just do it ! get inside and shut the door .
be leonard around ?
he go to the movie without me . it be the only option . i 'm sorry , i do n't understand which social situation this be . could you give me some guidance a to how to proceed ?
the building manager 's show an apartment downstairs , and i have n't paid my rent .
oh , i see . penny , i 'm not sure i 'm comfortable harbour a fugitive from the _ north los roble corporation .
it 's no big deal . i 'm just a little behind on my bill because they cut back my hour at the restaurant and my car broke down .
if you recall , i point out the “ check engine ” light to you several month ago .
well the “ check engine ” light be fine . it 's still blinking away . it 's the stupid engine that stop work . it cost me like twelve hundred dollar to fix it .
you know , it occurs to me you could solve all your problem by obtain more money .
yes , it occurs to me , too .
hang on a moment . here . take some . pay me back when you can .
that 's why it 's guard by snake . take some .
do n't be silly .
i 'm never silly . here .
no , i ca n't .
do n't you need money ?
well , yeah , but
this be money i 'm not use .
but what if you need it ?
i see no large upcoming expenditure unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine .
be they work on that ?
okay . well , thank you . oh , god , no , i ca n't . sheldon honey , i do n't want thing to be weird between u .
wo n't it also be weird if i have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you 're living in a refrigerator box and wash your hair with rain water ?
i 'll pay you back a soon a i can .
of course you will . it 's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can . assume you subscribe to a linear understand of time and causality .
i 'm regret this already .
you know , i 've give the matter some thought , and i think i 'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent alien .
interest .
ask me why .
do i have to ?
of course . that 's how you move a conversation forward .
why ?
the learn opportunity would be abundant . additionally , i like have my belly scratch .
hey , penny . how be work ?
great . i hope i 'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life .
be that sarcasm ?
no .
be that sarcasm ?
yes .
be that sarca
stop it !
penny , you appear to have a package here .
oh , thanks . this must be the beret i order . a couple of month ago . it be back-ordered .
do you know the beret be an example of piece of woman 's fashion adapt from male military uniform ? another fascinate example be the epaulet .
he 's not lie , he do find that fascinate .
oh , my god , would you just get off my case ?
weird .
oh , good , that be an unusual interaction . i be n't sure .
do you guy have an argument ?
no .
well , you clearly do something to aggravate her .
i 'm at a loss . if you like , you can review my daily log of social interaction and see if there 's a blunder i overlook .
here you go . oh , you owe me another two dollar . the price of mu-shu pork go up .
it 's get tougher and tougher to be a bad jew .
here you go , penny . shrimp with lobster sauce .
thank you , leonard . what 's my share ?
do n't worry about it . it 's my treat .
no , really , how much ?
well , which be it , ten or eleven ?
fourteen fifty , but it 's no biggie , you 'll get the next one .
he be just wonder if he wore skintight jean and a tank top if he 'd get his shrimp lo mein for free .
what be you say ? that i 'm use my body to get dinner ? that i 'm some kind of chinese food prostitute ?
‘ cause let me tell you something , buddy , i pay my own way in this world , okay ? i do n't rely on anybody ! what be that about ?
he have a nervous bladder when he 's stress out . kind of like a puppy .
here , leonard , ten , eleven , twelve , uh , fourteen dollar .
it be fourteen fifty , but it 's okay .
oh , good . dinner 's here .
yes , dinner 's here , and i 'm have some . i 'm have takeout food .
okay .
you 're damn right it 's okay . i 've be have leftover at the restaurant for like four day , and i want something different . so sue me .
sheldon , look , i will pay you back a soon a i can . you just have to give me more time .
oh , wait , you lent her money ?
she need money . you seem under pressure . do i not lend you a sufficient amount ? because i can give you more .
go home , where i wo n't be interrogate like a criminal . i forgot my fortune cookie .
in case either of you have larceny in your heart , you should know that i 've move my money out of the snake can .
but if you 're ever short , there 's always a couple of fifty in green lantern 's as .
hey .
hey .
a little mood light , huh ?
yeah . when i do n't pay my bill , the department of water and power thought i would enjoy the ambience .
yeah , they 're very considerate that way .
i use sheldon 's money to pay my rent , then i have like fourteen dollar left over .
put it back in your pocket , or i 'll find some other place to put it .
so you 're a little behind on your bill . everybody get behind on their bill .
yeah , i know , it 's just , this be n't the plan , it be n't suppose to go this way .
um , waitress for six month and then become a movie star .
tv star .
you 've have an act job where you get paid ?
that be not the definition of professional .
actually , it kind of let 's keep look . whoa , what 's eighteen hundred dollar to the los angeles county superior court ?
oh , that 's nothing .
nothing ? it sound like you get caught speed go _ mile an hour .
well , remember kurt ?
your ex-boyfriend ?
yeah . he get arrest for take a whiz on a cop car .
what ?
he be drunk .
i would hope so .
anyway , he have a bunch of outstanding ticket and a bench warrant , so i , you know , i paid his fine .
do he pay you back ?
no , but he will .
and that 's base on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicle ?
leonard , i 'm not gon na call up kurt and ask him for money .
well what be you gon na do ?
i do n't know , but i may have to find a cheaper place to live .
oh , no . oh , you do n't want to do that .
why not ?
well , i 'm sure the guy living with sheldon would n't mind move in with you .
oh , leonard , honey , if we start living together , i would n't be able to keep my hand off you .
really ?
and you thought my act lesson be a waste of money .
ugh . this mu-shu pork 's burning a hole through my duodenum .
leviticus _ : “ only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beast shall ye eat . ”
hey , do i mock you with the bhagavad-gita every time you scarf down a whopper ?
we 're on a quest through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown .
you want the valley of fire ? it 's right here .
hey , you guy want to go on a real live quest ?
outside ? i just make cocoa .

what be it ?
really ? you 're just gon na let me go by myself ?
oh , cool , i get a sword .
i could use some help .
here .
you guy be unbelievable , you play a game to simulate adventure , but when there 's real adventure out there in the real world , you just wimp out .
leonard , do you not recall the last time we visit this gentleman , we return home without pant ?
i do .
be you sure ? because your proposal suggests that you do n't .
i 'm not afraid of him .
all right . leonard fairly call the question , who be in favour of abandon our game and confront penny 's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him ? say hi to kurt for u .
excuse me . when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor , do n't samwise , pippin and merry go with him ?
they do .
well ?
they have a terrible time of it , leonard .
plus , no one stole their pant .
fine . just enjoy your little game . i 'll make this quest on my own .
leonard , wait . take a jacket , it 's spritz a little .
you guy suck . come on , please ? he 's so big .
okay , be everyone clear on the plan ?
yes . koothrappali 's go to wet himself , i 'm gon na throw up , sheldon 's gon na run away , and you 're go to die . shall we synchronize our watch ?
guy , there be four of u and one of him .
which mean his triumph will be even large . minstrel will write song about him .
okay , how about this ? i 'll do the talk , you just stand behind me and try to look formidable .
i should 've peed before we left .
hi , kurt .
i do n't really go by lenny , but that 's okay . um , you remember sheldon , howard and raj .
you do n't remember me ? how could he not remember me ?
sheldon , not now .
i remember him .
okay , here it be . penny 's in kind of a financial jam , and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solve her problem .
a successful quest . now let 's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom .
no , the problem be n't solve . he just blew u off .
i 've get it . he do n't remember me because the last time we met i be in a halloween costume .
come on , leonard , let 's go
no . you can leave if you want to . i 'm gon na see this through .
i do n't need backup . i have right on my side . and i 'm wear cargo short under my pant .
congratulation . you may not have succeed in get cash , but you do secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt .
maybe we should have your head notarize .
if anybody care , i still have to pee .
hey .

sarcasm ?
no .
darn . i ca n't seem to get the hang of that .
hey , i know it 's none of my business , but where do the money come from ?
that 's it ? do he give any reason a to why he come to this moral epiphany ?
nope . i just think he 's really change . we 're have dinner tomorrow night , and i get to wear my new beret . bye , guy .
bye .
well do , leonard . the true hero do n't seek adulation , he fight for right and justice simply because it 's his nature .
penny 's hook up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and i have indelible ink on my forehead !
that 's your badge of honour , your warrior 's wound , if you will . i be wrong , minstrel will write song about you .
great .
there once be a brave lad name leonard , with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee . he face a fearsome giant , while raj just want to pee .
fella , please .
you found it . it 's the sound of a cat be run over by a lawn mower .
i 'm really very busy . be there any way that we can put this off until i have more time to prepare ? of course . but , uh , you understand my trepidation .
not a clue .
ca n't we just postpone it till the spring ? maybe next summer ?
he 's refer to an activity he have do before . it 's unpleasant and need to be repeat . this suggests some sort of invasive medical test , like perhaps a colonoscopy .
be n't there any other option ? there 's not a lot of room , it 's gon na be uncomfortable .
yes , yes . yeah , i 'm definitely go with colonoscopy .
okay , bye . my mother 's come to visit .
how about that , you be right .
it 's out of order .
i think it implies that the elevator do n't work .

here 's your tea , mother .
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes .
i 'll start again .
i have the same problem with him . my theory be that his lack of focus stem from an over-developed sex drive .
that seem a fairly efficient arrangement .
of course . i would very much like to read about your sex life .
here 's your tea , mother . so , what be you guy talk about ?
the frequency with which your parent have intercourse .
swell . if you 're lucky , maybe she 'll show you the powerpoint presentation .
aw
so , mother , what 's new ?
maybe something less personal .
oh , my god . what happen ?
what a remarkable woman .
yeah i , i thought you guy might hit it off .
i envy you your childhood .
i hate to tell you , but the only warm memory i have of my childhood be of my uncle floyd .
you 're clearly misremember . your mother be brilliant , analytical , insightful , and i 'm bet she never hit you with a bible because you would n't eat your brussels sprout .
sheldon , you do n't give your mother enough credit . she 's warm , she 's love , she do n't glue electrode to your head to measure your brain wave while potty training .
you be lucky . when i be a kid , if i want an eeg , i have to attach my own electrode .
so , dr hofstadter , leonard rarely talk about his incredibly successful brother and sister .
please , do n't go there , howard .
i understand that unlike leonard , they 're at the top of their respective field .
boy , you suck .
so , she 's close to cure diabetes ?
wow , you must be very proud .
why be you do this ?
you know the rule . you brought your mom to work , you must suffer .
leonard , i have no idea your sibling be so much more successful than you .
yeah , you 're like the jar jar binks of the hofstadter family .
oh , meesa think yousa lookin ' so so sad .
you know , rather than mock me , my friend might realize that this be difficult and try to help me through it .
nope , i think mock you be more fun .
next time , do n't yousa bring mama to work . okee-day ?
that be fast .
it 's totally understandable . in bladder void , a in real estate , it 's location , location , location .
howard life with his mother and raj ca n't speak to woman unless he 's drunk . go .
it 's just temporary , i pay rent .
he life in the same room where his bassinet be .
you brought your husband to work , you know the rule . meesa think yousa look pretty sad now too , betcha , betcha .
there 's no hurry , mother , tell them more about their secret love for each other .
her reason be unassailable . it be one o'clock .
fine . let 's go . i think you 'll find my work pretty interest . i 'm attempt to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystal by the italian .
no .
just for the record , we 're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship .
well , then why do n't you say that to her ?
why be it always my responsibility ?
it 's not always your responsibility . i swear , this be the same thing you do at the comic book store last week .
i ca n't believe you 're bring that up .
i do n't bring it up . you do .

you ca n't let her get into your head .
my head , what about yours ?
it 's too late for me . my head be her summer house .
she be right , you know . the locus of my identity be totally exterior to me .
oh , yeah , there she be . hi , mom .
i mean , do you know where i be all morning ? audition with _ other blonde for some stupid antidepressant commercial . and for what ? so i 'll finally get my daddy 's approval ?

hey , you want to talk about not get love from a parent . you know what i use to do when i be little to have some sensation of human contact ?
yeah , you grabbed your penis and would n't let go . your mother told me .
of course she do . anyway , that 's not what i be gon na say . when i be ten year old , i built a hug machine .
a hug machine ?

my apology . i 've be living with your son too long . gotten into some bad habit .

it 's surprising because i generally do n't feel comfortable around , well , anyone .
what be the odds that two individual a unique a ourselves would be connect by someone a comparatively workaday a your son ?
i 'd like to do the math .
okay , now this time
uh-huh .
you 're gon na lick the salt off my neck , do the shot , and then bite the lime .
i 'm sorry , i do n't hear anything after lick .
neck , shot , lime . okay , shot , lime .
right . ah ! where 's the lime ? oh , okay , we 're share .
so , what do you think ?
normally , i 'd feel the same way . but base on everything i 've observe about u , i ca n't help but speculate we 'd be very good together .
i be hesitant the first time i try it , but i experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphin . it 's quite satisfy .
you see right through me , do n't you ?
this be actually gon na happen .

that be close .
god , i love the smell of paintball in the morning .
yeah , still funny , raj .
there 's no way we can get to the ridge . the chemistry department have u completely cut off .
but what about the creek bed ?
the pharmacology department control that , and they 're all hopped up on experimental steroid .
well , that 's it then , we 're doom .
i think the time have come to acknowledge that we be pay the price for some of u fail to attend my physic department paintball strategy meeting .
i told you my mom have spider vein , i have to take her to the laser clinic .
and i told you i want to see a doctor 's note .
we need a plan . how about operation hammer of the god ?

because you chose your mother 's vein over victory . on three . one , two , three , go !
i have to take her ! it 's almost bathing suit weather ! i surrender ! do n't shoot ! they go that way !
oh , leslie , thank god .

hey , leslie .
hey .
that 's great , leslie . thanks .
what be all that about ?
yeah , okay , but what 's with the back-scratching and the meow !
i believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provide good or service to the second party in compensation for a similar action .
thank you .
the mrow , that sound to me like an african civet cat .
be you do ?
you know what i 'm think ? i 'm think howard be n't make a back-scratching metaphor . i 'm think there be some actual scratch involve .
what about it , howard ?
okay , i do n't want to say anything 'cause i know you and leslie have a little history .
i do n't care about that .
great , 'cause i 've be die to say something .
you and leslie ?

be that why you do n't cover our escape and let u get cut down like animal ?
oh , yeah , sorry about that .
my good man , dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy be a court-martial offense .
court-martial , schmort-martial , leslie winkle be the fifth girl i 've ever have sex with . i mean , for free .

i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree . but , if you take advantage of modern marketing technique , and you optimize your manufacturing process , you might be able to make this a viable business .
and you know about that stuff ?
who 's radiohead ?
i have a work knowledge of the important thing in the universe . good luck .
sheldon , hold on . could you maybe show me how to make more money with this ?

why not eliminate the middle man ? we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom .
she 'd need some kind of industrial cool system .
of course , but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure , we should finish optimize the manufacturing process . to start with , she have a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump .

her research methodology be sloppy , she 's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity , and to make matter bad she 's often mean to me .
i think she 's smoking hot

look , i like leslie , but she 's not interested in date a much a use men a tool for stress release .

if you 're have trouble decide where to sit may i suggest one potato two potato , or a i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology .
do n't make this hard for me .

you 're right , it be simple .
hey , sheldon .
third floor tonight . mix it up ? oh . you know , i still do n't understand why you just do n't go to dinner or something .
alright , let 's say i go to dinner alone . and during the meal i have to use the rest room . how do i know someone 's not touch my food ?
goodnight sheldon .
penny , hold on . be you sure thing ca n't work out with you and leonard ?

i 'm just wonder if you really give it the old college try ? or in your case the old community college try ?
okay , where be this come from ?
leonard be upstairs right now with my arch enemy .
your arch enemy ?
yes , the doctor doom to my mr fantastic . the doctor octopus to my spiderman . the doctor sivana to my captain marvel .
okay , i get it , i get it , i get it .
do you know , it 's amaze how many supervillains have advanced degree . graduate school should probably do a well job of screen those people out .
sheldon , come back , you 're lose me .
leslie winkle , penny . she belittles my research .
oh , sweetie , i 'm sorry .
she call me dumbass .
i know . i heard .
give this situation , i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objection to your ill consider relationship with leonard .
oh , gee , well , thankyou for that . but , um , i think for now leonard and i be just go to stay friend .

sheldon , you be a smart guy , you must know
smart ? i 'd have to lose _ iq point to be classify a smart .
be you go to let me talk ?
i 'm sorry .
you must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together , nothing you can do be go to stop it .
you continue to underestimate my ability madam .
wait a minute , why be i do all the give here ? if leonard 's really my friend , why do n't he have to support me in my hatred of leslie winkle ?
oh now you 're just make stuff up .
okay . goodnight sheldon .
oh mario . if only i could control everyone the way i control you . hop , you little plumber , hop , hop , hop .
when the two of you reach a natural stop point i 'd like to have a word .
if the word be pee-pee , just do it .
leonard , you be my friend . and friend support their friend , apparently . so i be withdraw my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie .
thank you .
i will graciously overlook the fact that she be an arrogant sub-par scientist , who actually believe loop quantum gravity well unites quantum mechanic with general relativity than do string theory . you kid have fun .
i 'm listen , amuse me .
balderdash . matter clearly consists of tiny string .
okay , well , there be a lot of merit to both theory .
sheldon , do n't make that noise , it 's disrespectful .
i hope so , it be a snort of derision .
sorry leslie , i guess i prefer my space stringy not loopy .
truth , what truth ? we 're talk about untested hypothesis , uh , it 's no big deal .
i guess we let them wait until they 're old enough and let them choose their own theory .
look on the bright side .
what 's the bright side ?
only nine more month to comic-con .
oh yeah .
captain , i 'm get an unusual reading .

no , no , no , i just meant for yeah .
penny , just because people appreciate comic book do n't make them weirdo . stuart 's a terrific artist . he go to the rhode island school of design .
what about the guy over there in the superhero t-shirt tucked into his sweatpants ?
ah , yeah , that 's captain sweatpants . he do n't really help the point i 'm try to make .
let it go , sheldon .
why should i let it go ? i saw it first .
yes , but i saw it from the front .

when do you pick up on that ?
a moment ago , when you turn off the tv in the middle of during the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode . would you like some advice ?
sure , why not ?
then , this be the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comment section .
gee , thanks a lot .
would you rather i offer my personal insight ?
i do n't need any insight . i just want to know why penny 's more interested in stuart than me . we 're practically the same guy .
oh , i disagree . stuart be taller , artistic , self-employed and , most significantly , he get _ percent off comic book .
you 're right , i really should be ask stranger on the internet .
my original point .
chinese food , vintage video game . after the nightmare of anything can happen thursday , this be friday night the way it be meant to be .
who 's up for sheldon-free saturday ?
oh , hey guy .

no , he may not .
why ?
fine . i 'll have a chocolate martini .
wrong again !
come on , you know i ca n't talk to woman unless i 'm lit up like the hindu festival of diwali .
look , there be plenty of bar in los angeles where you can order grasshopper and chocolate martini , but you would n't have to because there be no woman in them .
gotcha . i 'll have a brandy alexander .
all right , the three musketeer just become the dynamic duo .
should we talk to some of these woman ?
it 's way too early in the night for that . see , first we let the lawyer and the jock thin the herd , and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame .
that 's your system ?
that 's my system . oh , and if you spot a chick with a see eye dog , she 's mine .
oh come on . i think it 's nice that captain sweatpants show up to your art opening .
um , you know , it 's kind of early . do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something ?
oh , you think coffee , mean coffee , that be so sweet . come on , i think i have decaf .

leslie winkle . you 've reach friend with benefit . for a booty call , press one now .
what exactly do that expression mean , friend with benefit ? do he provide her with health insurance ?
no . look , imagine you maintain a friendship with someone you have sex with , but you be free to date whoever you want .

okay , uh , if i get lucky i 'll take her to my stately manor outside gotham city , and if you get lucky , i 'll sleep on the moon .
sound like a plan .
hang on , i think the emergency key be around here somewhere .
we have a bowl . our key go in a bowl . you should get a bowl .
so , how do the beautiful mind of sheldon cooper forget his key in the first place .
oh-oh . i just remember where the emergency key be .
where ?
in your apartment .
well , i go in there a few week ago when you guy be n't home , and i forgot it there .
you be in my why would you what be you say ?
it 's not a big deal , i be make coffee and i ran out of milk .
you 're the milk thief ! leonard say i be crazy but i knew that carton felt lighter .
alright , sheldon , let 's just calm down and we 'll call the building manager , he 'll come open your door , you just eat your dinner here while you 're wait .
eat ? my dinner ? in your apartment ?
yeah , why not ?
sure , why not ? and after the sun 's down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek . ‘ cause today 's the day to stop make sense .
thanks .
hello .
why , yes , i love to party . party be my middle name . or it would be , if it be n't ramayan .
uh , raj , can i , can i talk to you for a moment .
what ? no . ..
maybe i can save her .
maybe , but i 'm guess it will cost you about $ _ an hour to try .
oh , i miss her already .
oh , howard 's lose it . check out his late twitter . “ i 'm at the bottom of a black hole star into the abyss . my life be meaningless , my future be without hope . ”
why do n't we take him to see the blue man group ?
usa today call them exuberant fun for the whole family .
i do n't know , howard be n't really the family fun kind of guy .
it 's too bad he be n't here for that hooker . she 's exactly his type . a hooker . you know , i bet if we hire her , that would cheer him up .
“ i 'm so lonely and horny i may open this $ _ jar of peanut and end it all . ”
suppose it would n't hurt to get an estimate .
so , how be your day ?
be you try to make small talk ? oh , sweetie , you really do n't have to .
no , it 's the accepted convention . how be your day ?
well , uh , they shift my schedule around at the restaurant so my hour be go to be a little different
i 'm sorry , that 's not go to interest me at all , just eat .
yeah , hi , listen , m , if you 're not busy , well , w-we be think you could well , we be wonder
if you 're really a prostitute .
okay , great . um uh , the thing be , we 've get this friend , and he 's kind of down in the dump , and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up .
with sex .
i think she know what i meant .
how can she when you beat around the bush . she 's from the mean street where they shoot from the hip and keep it real .
okay , terrific . um , uh , listen , be there a way that we can do this where he do n't know that you 're a you know
prostitute .
yes , yeah , exactly , the girlfriend experience .
uh , actually , if it 's not too much to ask , could we have the jewish girlfriend experience .
okay , that 's question _ , you have to guess .
oh , god , i do n't know sheldon , be you star war ?
how can one person be a whole movie ?
okay , i give up , can we just do something else ?
fine . i be spock . be you and leonard friend with benefit .
what ?
be you and leonard friend with benefit ?
where do that even come from , do he say we be ?
no , leonard say nothing , but who know what go on over here when he pretend your mail be misdeliver .
no , just mail , no benefit .
hmm , i see .
why be you ask ?
can you ?
excuse me ?
be you able to have sex with men without develop an emotional attachment ?
be this conversation make you uncomfortable ?
of course it 's make me uncomfortable , ca n't you tell ?
i 'm uncomfortable , sheldon !
thank you , that 's very helpful .
alright , where be these amaze shrimp ?
behold ?
seriously , you think this be the size of a baby 's arm ?
a little baby .
i 'm go back to the room .
hi there , howard wolowitz .
i do n't think the manager 's come tonight so , here .
well , it be n't the first suggestion that come to mind , but it 's the one i 'm go with .
i ca n't sleep on your couch . i sleep in a bed . and give it 's dimension i have no intention of living out e.m snicker 's beloved child 's book , the tall man from cornwall .
what ?
oh , alright . i will give you my bed on one condition . that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hour .
may i say one last thing .
only if it do n't rhyme .
alright . goodnight .
really , me too .
cut the crap , you set this up , do n't you ?
yes .
she 's a hooker , be n't she .
a prostitute , yes .
you already give her the money ?
thank you !
penny .
what ?
i ca n't sleep . how be you go ?
maybe that 's because your hole be still open .
i 'm homesick .
your home be twenty foot from here .
twenty foot , twenty light year , it do n't matter . it 's in a galaxy far , far away .
damn it . what do you want me to do
sing soft kitty .
that 's only for when you 're sick .
homesick be a type of be sick .
come on , do i really have to ?
i suppose we can stay up and talk .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur . happy kitty , um
sleepy kitty .
sleepy ki
no . start over .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur . happy kitty , sleepy kitty , purr , purr , purr .
oh , you 're welcome sweetie .
okay , i 'm sleepy now , get out .
oh , good , you 're finally home .
what be you do at penny 's ?
well , we have dinner , uh , played some game , and then i spent the night . oh , you 'll be happy to know that i now have a much well understand of friend with benefit .
smell that ? that 's the smell of new comic book . oh , yes !
they 're on me today , boy .
you 're pay ? have you be sell your sperm again ?
no , i 'm celebrate . a we speak , the space shuttle be dock at the international space station where it will deploy the wolowitz zero-gravity waste disposal system .
oh , get over yourself , it 's a high-tech toilet .
just think . thanks to your hard work , an international crew of astronaut will boldly go where no man have go before .
be that suppose to be funny ?
i believe it be . the combination of the star trek reference and the play on word involve the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard be humorously mock your effort in space plumbing .
okay , make your little joke , but of the four of u , i 'm the only one make any real-world contribution to science and technology .
he 's right . this be an important achievement , for two reason . number one , and , of course , number two .
oh , clever ! play on the use of cardinal number a euphemism for bodily function .
excuse me , spoiler alert .
you told me it 's mind-blowing , so , my mind be go into it pre-blown . and once a mind be pre-blown , it can not be re-blown .
say the grinch to christmas .
oh , sure , what 's up ?
yeah , vaguely .
sure you remember . you go to the bar and make a fool of yourself try to pick up strange woman .
what about it ?
oh , too bad . i guess the thing to do now be just pick yourself up , dust yourself off , forget it and move on .
excuse me , stuart . have you read the new flash ?
well , i have and it will knock your sock off ! good luck get them back on .
nobody want that .
uh , oh , gee , my initial reaction be no . you know , let me think about it and get back to you , okay ?
yeah , or you call me .
or nobody call anyone .
interest . penny 's current suitor ask advice from her former suitor .
you know , thanks for closed-captioning my pain , raj .
hey , wan na make sure he get nowhere with penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them ?
i 'm listen .
just tell him to do everything you 've do with her for the last two year .
hey , leonard .
oh , hi .
how 's it go ?
good , good . you ?
fine . oh , hey , can i ask you something ?
sure .
you know your friend stuart ?
yes .
well , he ask me out again and i say yes , and then i start think maybe i should talk to you first .
about what ?
well , do it bother you , me go out with one of your friend ? ‘ cause you know , you and me
well , in that case , do you mind give me some advice ?
about stuart ? love to .
he 's very shy , how do i make him feel more comfortable around me ?
well , uh , first of all , do n't underestimate the value of discomfort .
really ?
well , yeah , stuart thrives under pressure , that 's why he work in a comic book store .
oh . it 's stuart .
you 're not go to answer it ?
he want to talk about penny . i do n't want to talk about penny .
you 're make an assumption . perhaps the comic book store be on fire , and he need your assistance .
why would he call me ?
we do n't know . and if you do n't answer the phone , we ca n't know .
i 'm not answer the phone , sheldon .
answer the phone , leonard .
no ! there , it go to voice mail .
be n't you go to check your message ?
no .
at time .
guy , we have a code red .
do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert , code red the computer worm , or code red the cherry flavour soft drink from the maker of mountain dew ?
look , i be go over the schematic on my zero-g toilet , and i make a teeny tiny mistake on the specification for the diverter valve .
how teeny tiny ?
it 's gon na fail after about ten flush .
but the mission be for six month .
no . be you crazy ? what be i gon na say ? i screw up your toilet and pretty soon there 's gon na be crap float all over your nice shiny space station ?
i 'm gon na figure out how to fix it , then i 'll tell them .
so , what do you need u for ?
he ca n't figure out how to fix it .
i 'm try , but you have to admit this be pretty damn funny .
i agree . it 's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunction toilet that provide the comic fodder here . check your message .
all right , this be an exact duplicate of the wolowitz zero-gravity human waste disposal system a deployed on the international space station .
yeah .
yeah , i have to say , i thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition . apparently , there be no law of diminish comedic return with space poop .
hey stuart .
um
classify , leonard .
yeah , i 'm sorry , it 's be broken .
yeah , that too . everything 's broken .
all right , well , off the top of my head , i think the most important thing with penny be to go really slow . i mean , glacial .
yeah , like , you 're afraid that if you touch her , she 'll break .
good , good . well , you kid have fun tonight .
you do n't know what this be ?
good . get out .
be afraid of penny , nice , very crafty .
for what it 's worth , my mother say that when we deceive for personal gain , we make jesus cry .
all right , what if we use this two-inch pvc to reinforce the centre cross-support ?
maybe if you be help , you 'd feel well about yourself .
i deliberately try to sabotage stuart 's date with penny .
of course you feel terrible . you completely screw up your karma , dude .
you do n't really believe in that superstition , do you ?
okay , look . instead of try to reinforce this structure here , what if we just ran another line , bypass it entirely ?
it wo n't work . the diameter of the tube be insufficient .
what if we reposition the collection tank ?
it wo n't work . no way to mount it .
okay , here 's an idea . what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel ?
that could work .
morning .
morning . what 's up ?
nothing . we just pull an all-nighter try to fix a zero-gravity pasta maker . i 'm gon na make a coffee run . do you want any ?
oh , no , thanks . i have coffee .
i really do n't want to talk about it .
yeah . right . sure . the thing be , before you guy go out , i spoke to him and
i say i do n't want to talk about it .
okay i just i kind of
look , leonard , what go on between me and stuart be none of your business . so just leave it alone , okay ?
if you really want to clean up your karma , go get my freakin ' latte .
you 're overestimate the tensile strength of the substructure you 're building .
howard , wait . why do n't you use this instead of the pvc to keep the transverse filter assembly in place ?
because this be not a spare part from the space station . this be the thing from the pizza box that keep the lid from touch the cheese .
comic book store .
oh , an excellent idea ! i could certainly use a break .
me , too .
hold on , you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space .
why do leonard get to go ?
‘ cause he 's upset over his situation with penny and if i have to hear about it again , i 'm go to kick him in his ovary .
thanks for understand , howard .
i get your back , sister . all right , i think we 've get a prototype ready to test . hand me that tupperware .
wow , that 's heavy .
i must say , howard , i think a detailed letter to mit describe your current circumstance might entitle you to a refund on your master 's degree .
fascinate .
what do you think the problem be ?
not enough bread crumb .
hey , stuart , i need to talk to you .
i think i give you bad advice about penny , and i want to apologize .
it be ?
you 're kid . never work for me .
wine ? i do n't say to give her wine .
during the kiss ? what do you do , sneeze in her mouth ? i do that to a girl once .
leonard ?
no doubt , no doubt . okay , well , i 'm sorry it do n't work out .
yeah , how about that ? see you soon .
what 's classify ?
howard 's space toilet . i 'll tell you later .
well , they 've deployed our solution . let 's just all hope it work .
i do n't see why i have to worry . my career 's not hang in the balance . that be a joke . it 's funny , because it 's true .
leonard , could you pas the soy sauce , please ?
i 'm sorry , be you talk to me ?
yeah , i say leonard .
yes , you do , do n't you ?
what the hell be that ?
meatloaf .
what be it do on the ceiling ?
that 's classify .
oh , boy .
what ?
i ca n't comment without violate our agreement that i do n't criticize your work .
then what be oh , boy ?
great restraint on my part .
there 's nothing wrong with the science here .
perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science .
okay , how 's that ?
it do n't say . it must be an emergency . everyone at the university know i eat breakfast at eight and move my bowel at _ .
yes , how do we live before twitter ? i guess you 'll find out what it be in the morning .
leonard . leonard . leonard .
sheldon , it 's two o'clock in the morning .
why be everybody keep tell me what time it be ?
everybody ?
you , the president of the university , his wife , their sullen teenage daughter . that entire family be fascinate by what time it be and whether people know it .
you go to president seibert 's house in the middle of the night ?
he do n't respond to my e-mail , his phone number be unlisted . tell me what my other option be .
you could have wait until morning . i know , look who i 'm talk to .
do you remember the grant proposal i submit to the national science foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic north pole ?
hardly a day go by when i do n't think about it .
aw , how nice . well , a space open up at the last minute on the nsf expedition to the arctic circle .
yes . in fact , he be quite enthusiastic . he say , “ frankly , if i could send you tonight , i would . ”
okay , well , do you want to go ?
sarcasm ?
maybe .
i 'm on the horn of a dilemma . can you imagine me , sheldon cooper , at the north pole ?
easy peasy , i 'm do it right now .
well , then do n't go .
how can you say that ? the scientific opportunity of a lifetime present itself and my best friend say do n't go .
all right , then go .
listen to you . how can i possibly go ?
sheldon , what be the word i can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep ?
odd , president seibert pose the exact same question .
how be it resolve ?
it be n't . his wife set their dog on me and render the question moot .
just imagine . if he say yes , we 'll have an entire summer without sheldon .
we could play outside .
we could sit on the left side of the couch .
i could use the bathroom at _ .
our dream be very small , be n't they ?
…the invitation to join the arctic expedition .
it 's not gon na be the same without you .
godspeed .
thank you , but your sentiment may be premature .
i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me .
to the north pole ?
yes .
be this just so we wo n't touch your stuff while you 're away ?
i 'll admit that be a concern . but the fact be , i 'll need a support team . and the three of you be my first choice .
really ?
i 'm still within earshot ! you may want to wait for my door to close .
we 're not really gon na go to the north pole with him , be we ?
hang on . let 's talk about it . this be a national science foundation expedition . i do n't know how we can turn it down .
howard , this be big science . you could be the engineer who build the equipment that put u on the cover of magazine .
i could also be the engineer who build the crossbow that kill sheldon .
you still might get on a magazine .
so you guy be seriously consider this ?
yes .
i 'm in .
me , too .
oh , damn it . peer pressure . fine .
excellent . and just an fyi , a i be the expedition 's team leader , protocol dictate that be phrase fine , sir . but do n't worry , there will be a briefing .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
sheldon .
sheldon .
penny .
what do you want ?
i need access to the cheesecake factory 's walk-in freezer .
now , honey , i already told you , the hamburger meat be fresh and store at a safe temperature .
no . this be to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic north pole .
what ?
i do n't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you , but to elaborate , i 'm go to the arctic circle with leonard , wolowitz and koothrappali .
yes .
for three month ?
yes .
excuse me .
hi .
sheldon say you 're go to the north pole .
yeah . pretty cool , huh ?
yeah . i 'm just a little surprised you do n't tell me .
yes , yes , you be busy , you be surprised , all very fascinate . now where do we stand on the freezer ?
be he serious ?
all right , i 'll see what i can do . so , three month at the north pole . wow , that be awesome .
yeah .
i 'm sorry , but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action ?
just a warn , sheldon , the freezer lock from the outside .
do she seem upset to you ?
no . do she seem upset to you ?
no .
oh , good , i get it right . be you upset ?
a little bit .
two for two . i 'm on fire .
i mean , i know she 's not my girlfriend or anything , but would n't you think she 'd feel a little bad that i 'm go to be go for the whole summer ?
that feel like a bonus question . i 'm go to stop here while i 'm ahead , but i 've have a great time .
where be your tool ?
and begin .
i think i swallow some paint !
i ca n't press any of the button with my glove . oh , son of a bitch !
adversity be to be expect . continue .
oh , boy , be i gon na get sue .
okay , i ca n't do this .
me either .
hang on , i know i do n't posse the tool of leadership , but i do n't understand why we ca n't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside .
i have n't thought of that . i guess we 're do here .
here , drink slash eat this .
what be it ?
it 's hot chocolate with a stick of butter .
okay , why ?
because in the frigid temperature in the arctic , we need to consume at least _ calorie a day just to maintain our body weight .
sheldon , you know i ca n't eat butter . i 'm lactose intolerant .
way ahead of you , that 's an “ i ca n't believe it 's not butter ” stick .
but mummy , all the other guy be go to the north pole .
if you be stand behind me nag , i might .
no , it 's not . howard , tell them .
that 's very unlikely , mr koothrappali . if raj dy , it 'll be from frostbite , gangrene , acute sunburn or be ripped to shred by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear .
ma , i 'm put you on speakerphone with raj 's parent . can you tell them that you 're okay with me go to the arctic ?
arctic ? i thought you say arkansas !
i do n't say that . you never listen to me !
he do n't tell me anything ! he life a secret life because he 's ashamed !
hey , leonard , can i talk to you for a sec ?
sure , but let 's go out here where there 's a little less yell and guilt . what 's up ?
well , i get you a little go away present .
oh , a blanket .
oh , no , no , no , not just a blanket . see , it have sleeve . yeah ! so , you can , you know , be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff .
oh , wow , cool .
oh , i 'm gon na miss you . see you later .
bye .
sheldon , sheldon ?
i want a cookie , meemaw .
sheldon , it 's me .
listen , i do n't know if i can go on the expedition .
what ?
i do n't think i can go to the north pole .
yeah , that 's very comfort .
comfort be a part of leadership . it 's not a part i care for , but such be my burden .
terrific , it 's just that i do n't think penny want me to go .
assume that 's a valid reason not to go , which it be n't , how do you know this ? do she say it ?
not exactly . but she say she be gon na miss me and she give me this .
what be it ?
it 's a blanket with sleeve .
oh , that 's clever . let me see if i understand this correctly . her miss you be an emotional state you find desirable ?
yes , obviously .
all right . well , give that miss you be predicate on you leave , logic dictate you must leave .
yes , okay , but i 'm gon na be go for three month . what if she do n't miss me that long and she meet someone else ?
she do have a short attention span .
so , i ca n't go .
leonard , you may be right . it appear that penny secretly want you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion .
you really think so ?
of course not . even in my sleep-deprived state , i 've manage to pull off another one of my classic prank . bazinga !
oh , leonard , what time be it ?
it 's _ a.m . i 'm sorry it 's early , but we 're leave soon , and i need to talk to you .
okay .
what do you mean when you say you 're go to miss me ?
um , i do n't know . you 'll be go and i 'll notice .
okay , well , um , what about this ? what do this mean ?
wine , credit card and late night television be a bad combination .
all right , fine . what about that really long hug ? what do that mean ?
that be n't a long hug .
leonard , i do n't know what to tell you . it be just a hug .
glad we clear that up .
i guess i 'll see you .
okay , have a safe trip .
thank you . bye .
okay , bye . mean i wish you be n't go .
damn it .
we 're out of ice .
yeah , wow .
so , who 's up for a movie ?
good idea , what do you think ? ice station zebra or john carpenter 's the thing ?
i say double feature .
what be we have ?
reconstitute thai food .
check .
freeze-dried spicy mustard ?
flash-frozen brown rice , not white ?
uh , oh , sorry .
not to worry . i hid it . bazinga ! you 're in my spot .
there 's no time for a crossbow . find me an icicle .
three month . this be gon na be great !
you appear to have put your car key in the door lock , be you aware of that ?
yeah !
alright then .
dammit , dammit , dammit , dammit , dammit , dammit .
would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly ?
i ca n't get the damn key out .
well that 's not surprising . that baldwin lock on your door us traditional edge mount cylinder , whereas the key for your volkswagon us a centre cylinder system .
thankyou , sheldon .
you 're welcome . point of inquiry , why do you put your car key in the door lock ?
oh , sonofabitch !
i believe the condensation on your frozen food weaken the structural integrity of the bag . but return to your key conundrum , perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you .
i do , and he say he 'll get here when he get here .
and you 're frustrate because he phrase his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology ?
no ! i be frustrate because i be a failure at everything and my breath smell like fly .
there there . would you prefer to wait in our apartment ?
no sheldon , i 'd rather sit on this freeze cold floor sob like a three year-old .
alright then .
just when i think i 've gotten the hang of sarcasm .
make yourself comfortable . not there . sheldor be back online .
sheldor ?
the conqueror .
afk . i 'm play age of conan , an online multiplayer game set in the universe of robert e howard 's conan the barbarian .
sheldor , back online .
afk . away from keyboard .
oic .
what do that stand for ?
oh , i see ?
yes , but what do it stand for ?
now just click on the enchant boot to put them on .
oh , i do n't know . can i see them in another colour ?
just click on them . congratulation , you be now a level three warrior .
what 's go on ?
leonard , guess what , i 'm a level three warrior .
great , you know there be grocery outside of your apartment ?
yeah yeah yeah , shhh !
i only bring it up because your ice-cream be melt and it 's start to attract wildlife .
uh-huh , yeah , do i stay in the jungle or go towards the beach ?
it do n't matter , right now you 're look for treasure .
okay . wait , wait , where be you go ?
you 're okay , if you run into crocodile just kick them with your boot .

be you insane ? you 're not go to party with them , you 're not even go to get anywhere near that place .
that 's what they say to neil armstrong about the moon .

well , my fellow american , before this year be out we will put a wolowitz on one of america 's top model .
and a large number of people will believe it never happen .

i 'll tell you what , how about we go rock-paper-scissors ?
hello , boy .
ahoy , matey .
notice the eye patch , do you ? it 's all part of a technique i 've be study for pick up woman . you employ a visual display design to make yourself distinctive and memorable .
oh yes , like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rut baboon with engorge hindquarter .
or in this case , the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye .
mock me if you will , but it work . you show up at a club in something distinctive , scope out your target and toss out some negs .
what be negs ?
howard , your scooter 's block my car . aw , do you get pinkeye again ?
step one , she notice the eye patch . may i say , penny , not a lot of woman could look a hot a you do with such greasy hair ?
yeah , just move your stupid scooter before i pick it up and throw it in the dumpster .
ow .
i 'm sorry , but i 'm not go to watch the clone war tv series until i 've see the clone war movie . i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me in the order he intend .
well , i want to watch it now .
then i believe we 've arrive at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors lizard-spock moment .
watch whatever you want .
i saw what you do there .
what do i do ?
hello . hey , howard . what 's wrong ? okay . okay , we 'll be right there .
what happen ?
howard 's at the mar rover lab . he say he 's in trouble . defcon _ .
defcon _ ? well , there 's no need to rush .
what ?
defcon _ mean no danger . defcon _ be a crisis .
how can _ not be bad than _ ?
yeah , star trek v , bad than i .
okay , first of all , that 's a comparison of quality , not intensity . secondly , star trek i be orders-of-magnitude bad than star trek v .
be you joking ? star trek v be the standard against which all badness be measure .
no , no , no . star trek v have specific failure in write and direction , while star trek i fails across the board , art direction , costume , music , sound edit .
can we just forget i say defcon and go ?
star trek v !
all right , will you at least stipulate that star trek iv : the voyage home be inarguably the best ?
i have three word for you . wrath of khan .
oh , thank god , you 're here .
i get the mar rover stuck in a ditch .
where ?
on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield . where do you think ? on mar !
you brought a girl to the mar rover control room ?
yeah , i picked her up in the bar . she 's a doctor . one free barium enema and my mother wo n't care she 's not jewish .
wait a minute , so the eye patch and the insult work ?
so what exactly do you want u to do ?
i need you and raj to help me get the rover out of the ditch , and i need you to get stephanie out before somebody notice she 's here . she do n't exactly have clearance .
okay .
i 'll call ya .
no one 's a scientist like howard .
my mother be so gon na love her .
oh , how nice . maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison .
just say howard 's a terrific guy . he 's get a great sense of humour , he love his mother , a lot , some people say too much .
yeah , i be loyal . you know , if you look at the big picture . just , out of curiosity , do he ever have a shot with you ?
then why do you ?
get it . so , can i see you again ?
ooh . cool .
anything ?
actually , i be just check my e-mail . but , uh , no , the rover be not respond .
i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any mean of propulsion .
hang on , there 's get to be other option .
you could try call triple-a , but base on nasa 's late timetable , they wo n't get there for _ year .
plus i understand you have to be stand next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive .
oh , snap .
snap what ?
ok , i guess we have to turn to plan b .
what 's plan b ?
howard , do n't you say you work on the mar rover ?
no , you 're mistaken .
yeah , when we first met , you say that if i go out with you , i could drive a car on mar .
i do n't know what you 're talk about .
psst ! psst !
will you all excuse me ? leonard be subtly signal that he 'd like to talk to me in private .

i ca n't tell you that , either .
so you brought me in here to inform me that you ca n't tell me where you 're go and you ca n't tell me who might ask ?
yeah , i really do n't think this through .
leonard , a moment .

howard , come on , i do n't plan on this . these thing just happen . usually not to me , but they do happen .

penny , hello .
what be shake ?
i 'm sorry ?
it 's colloquial , a conversation opener . so , do you find the weather satisfy ? be you currently share in the triumph of some local sport team ?
what 's wrong with you ? you 're freak me out .
please do n't do that .
all right , but i 'm give to understand that when you have something awkward to discus with someone , it 's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat .
so , this be n't the awkward part ?
no .
oh , all right . s ' u'up ?
oh , good , i use that right . anyway , you 're aware that leonard have enter into a new romantic relationship which include a sexual component ?
okay , feel the awkward now .
her name be dr stephanie barnett and she be a highly distinguish surgical resident at freemont memorial .
yeah , leonard told me .
good . what he may have left out be how important this relationship be to me .
to you ?
yes , see , of the handful of woman leonard 's be involve with , she 's the only one i have ever found tolerable .
well , what about me ?
well , be n't you sweet ?
anyway , should you have any interaction with her , it would be most helpful that she not see you a a sexual rival .
yeah , i think she 's pretty safe .
i could think about you .
fine , whatever work .
always nice talk to you , sheldon .
uh , peace out !
well , this be very pleasant .
i 'm glad you 're enjoy yourself .
and you say there 'd never be enough pasta for the three of u .

you know , italian housewife have a rule of thumb . a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter be sufficient for each person a it double in volume when cooked .
she do n't mean it . she 's just be nice .
good . what 's your favourite fruit ?
hmm , technically not a fruit , but all right . where do you do your medical internship ?
really ? that 's where i be born !

radiation burn . a little mishap while i be building my own cat scanner .
i do . do you ? because frankly , you 've be in a foul mood since i sat down .
okay , here 's my question , why do you sit down ?
to help . look , if you fail at this relationship , and history suggests you will , then we risk lose the medical officer that our land party have always need .
what land party ?
you 're kirk , i 'm spock , wolowitz be scotty , koothrappali be the guy who always get kill , and now we 've get mccoy .
oh , my god , what do you do ?
i have a bone to pick with you , sir .
oo-oo-oh !

yeah , furthermore , earlier this even , she threw a digital sheep at some guy name mike . who 's mike ? why do he get a digital sheep and not you ?
it 's just her facebook page and we 've only be go out a couple of week .
you do n't see it , do you ? we 're lose her .
okay , i 'm go to make this very simple for you . you be not in this relationship , i be . ergo , you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie .
general order _ , section a do not apply in this situation .
because this be not star trek
penny penny penny .
what ?
this be banana bread .
this be a door knob .
it 's my understand that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat .
sheldon , would you like to come in ?
i suppose i could spare a few minute . be you robbed ?
no .
how can you be sure ?
sheldon , what do you want ?
i 'm certain this will come a no surprise to you , but leonard be fail in yet another relationship .
he 's have problem with stephanie ?
because ?
gentleman , i have a question about date and relationship .
you told me you be go to have the talk with him .
i 've be wait for someone to have the talk with me .
more to the point , it 's about find a way to keep leonard and stephanie together .
oh , i do n't think you can .
well , why not ?
look at leonard 's record . _ day with joyce kim .
during which she defect to north korea .
two booty call with leslie winkle .
for which she award him the nickname “ speed of light leonard . ”
and a three hour dinner with penny .
which would have be two and a half if they order the souffle when they sat down .
base on the geometric progression , his relationship with stephanie should have end after _ minute .
yes , i 'm aware of the math , y equal _ day over _ to the nth , the issue remains , how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection ?
well , if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie , your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet .
yes .
yeah .
penny penny .
what ?
penny . zucchini bread .
oh , thank you .
may i come in ?
no .
i see . apparently my earlier inquiry regard you and leonard cross some sort of line . i apologize .

mother , i have to go . yeah , love you . bye . hello , old friend . daddy 's home .
leonard , you 're back .
yeah , i just stop by to say yeah , so , hi !
hi !
yeah , it be first come , first serve .
i just want you both to know , when i publish my finding , i wo n't forget your contribution .
great .
thanks .
of course , i ca n't mention you in my nobel acceptance speech , but when i get round to write my memoir you can expect a very effusive footnote , and perhaps a sign copy .
we have to tell him .
tell me what ?
damn his vulcan hearing .
you fellow be planning a party for me , be n't you ?
okay , sheldon , sit down .
if there 's go to be a theme , i should let you know that i do n't care for luau , toga or under the sea .
yeah , we 'll keep that in mind , look , we need to talk to you about something that happen at the north pole .
if this be about the night the heat go out , there 's nothing to be embarrass about .
and we agree to never speak of it again .
so we slept together naked . it be only to keep our core body temperature from plummet .
he 's speak about it .
sheldon , you remember the first few week we be look for magnetic monopoles and not find anything and you be act like an obnoxious , giant dictator ?
i thought we be go to be gentle with him .
that 's why i add the tator . and then when we found our first positive data , you be so happy .
oh , yes . in the world of emoticon , i be colon , capital d .
well , in actuality , what your equipment detect be n't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles a it be static from the electric can opener we be turn on and off .
he just go colon , capital o .
you tamper with my experiment ?
we have to .
it be the only way to keep you from be such a huge dickensian . you see that ? i add the ensian .
do leonard know about this ? leonard 's my best friend in the world . surely leonard do n't know .
actually , it be his idea .
of course it be . the whole plan reek of leonard .
i miss you so much .
i miss you , too .
i could n't even think of anyone else while you be go .
leonard . leonard . leonard .
do not make a sound .
whisper do not make a sound be a sound .
damn his vulcan hearing . not a good time , sheldon .
penny . penny . penny .
oh , this be ridiculous . what ?
hello , penny . i realize you 're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urge , but a you have an entire lifetime of poor decision ahead of you , may i interrupt this one ?
it 's great to see you too . come on in .
wolowitz have inform me of your grand deception . do you have anything to say for yourself ?
it be the only way to make him happy .
why do you have to make him happy ?
no , the overreaction be the plan to tie your limb to four different sled dog team and yell mush . look , we kept the original data . you can still publish the actual result .
yes , but the actual result be unsuccessful and i 've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explain that i have confirm string theory and forever change man 's understand of the universe .
aw , see , yeah , you probably should n't have do that . so write another e-mail , set the record straight , it 's no big deal .
yeah , i feel terrible .
wait , wait . be n't you go to go talk to him ?
what ? uh , he 'll be fine , the guy 's a trouper , come here .

i like the new look .
thanks . i call it the clooney .
i call it the mario and luigi , but whatever . hey , how 's sheldon do ?
well , he come out of his room this morning wear his darth vader helmet and try to choke me to death with the force , so i 'd say , a little well .
if i may abruptly change the subject , do you and penny finally you know .
howard
personally , i do n't care , but my genitals want me to ask .
he say they do n't do it .
sheldon , over here .
what be you do ?
i feel bad for the guy .
sheldon , why be you sit by yourself ?
because i be without friend . like the proverbial cheese , i stand alone . even while seat .
come on . we say we be sorry .
it 's go to take more than i 'm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from penny to make up for what you 've do to me .
you see ? people have be point and laugh at me all morning .
all right , i 've have enough . attention , everyone . i ' m dr sheldon cooper . a many of you in the physic department might know , my career trajectory have take a minor detour .
my credibility may have be damage
oh , you think you 're so clever . well , let me just tell you , while i do not currently have a scathing retort , you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy .
so much for our friendship with sheldon .
well , we 'll always have the night the heat go out .
hi .

uh-huh . it 'll last forever . i preserve it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin .
it 's actually a pretty simple process . you see , cyanoacrylate be monomer which polymerize on
red alert , leonard . sheldon ran away .
man , i can not catch a break .
so , how do you know he ran away ?
well , he 's not answer his phone , he hand in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that say , i 'm run away .
okay , well , thanks for let me know .

evolution be n't an opinion , it 's fact .
i forgive you . let 's go home .
how about that ? i finally caught a break .
uh-huh .
sure .
why do it have to get weird ?
i do n't know .
i mean , we be friend , and now we 're more than friend . we 're whatever this be . but why label it , right ? i mean , it be what it be and
leonard ?
yeah ?
it 's weird .
hey , leonard , check this out .
leonard , she 's do it again .
no . it upset sheldon when she willy-nilly take it from the container without regard for it equitable distribution . this be essentially why you have famine in india .
you want me to put it back ?
leonard .
it upset sheldon when you play with the sheldon .
what 's up , my nerdizzles ? raj , sheldon , i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette .
hello .
yeah . hey .
bernadette , say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles .
sure . the more , the merrier .
wait , no , that 's a false equivalency . more do not equal merry . if there be _ people in this apartment right now , would we be celebrate ? no , we 'd be suffocate .
sheldon
do n't sheldon me . we order for five people , not six .
oh , come on , it 's fine . we 'll just put it all on the table , you know , family style .
oh , sure . and while we 're at it , why do n't we put our hand behind our back , have an old-fashioned eat contest ?
relax , it 'll be fine , sit down , you guy .
oh , yeah , you ca n't sit there .
that 's where sheldon sits .
oh , thanks . they be cute , be n't they ?
shoe for less .
oh , great selection , great price .
my mother be right . hell be real .
come on , sheldon . let the womenfolk chat .
womenfolk ?
gal ? chick ? utero-americans ?
just eat your dinner .
yeah , well , i do n't think it 's very funny .
howard , never let her go .
i be . be you interested in physic ?
actually , my test of the aharonov-bohm quantum interference effect have reach an interest point . right now , we 're test the phase shift due to an electric potential .
yes . leonard 's work be nearly a amaze a third grader grow lima bean in wet paper towel . while i appreciate the oh , snap , i 'm uncomfortable have your moist breath in my ear .
yes , i be . you want to see a simulation on my laptop ?
howard ?
yeah ?
your shoe be delightful . where do you get them ?
what ?
bazinga . i do n't care .
ha ! eat my dust , racially stereotypical plumber .
that 's not fair . i get stuck behind a tree .
and a cow and a penguin . face it dude , whether it 's a real car or a virtual cartoon car , you ca n't drive .
just need a little more practice .
what you need be cheat code , motor skill and a magic genie who grant wish to little boy who suck at mario kart .
hey , sheldon , can i talk to you for a second ?
it 's not about shoe .
um , actually , can we do it in private ?
all right . go away . i agree , it 's rude , but she ask for privacy .
thanks , raj . okay , so here 's the thing , i be wonder if you could maybe teach me a little physic ?
a little physic ? there 's no such thing . physic encompasses the entire universe , from quantum particle to supernova , from spin electron to spin galaxy .
yeah , okay , cool . i do n't need the pb special , i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job . you know , like bernadette do .
why ca n't leonard teach you ?
‘ cause i want to surprise him .
ca n't you surprise him in some other way ? for example , i 'm sure he 'd be delightfully take aback if you clean your apartment .
come on , sheldon , this be important to me .
penny , this would be a massive undertaking , and my time be both limited and valuable .
you 're sit here play video game all day .
okay , point . what sort of foundation do you have ? do you take any science class in school ?
sure . i do the one with the frog .
the one with the frog .
yeah , actually , it be pretty cool . a lot of the girl threw up , but i gutted that thing like a deer .
i 'm sorry , penny , i do n't think so .
oh , come on ! a smart guy like you , it 'll be a challenge . you can make it like an experiment .
interest . i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla , i could teach you some rudimentary physic .
great ! it 's a little insult , but great . i 'll be koko .
not likely . koko learn to understand over _ word , not one of which have anything to do with shoe .
hey , fella . this be my girlfriend bernadette . my girlfriend bernadette .
have no idea . hey , leonard .
hey , look , it 's howard and his girlfriend bernadette .
thought i 'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mine .
yeah , no , i get it .
ah , terrific . we 're get the electron accelerator set up . we should be ready to go day after tomorrow .
you 're welcome to come .
like hanukkah in july .
no .

thanks , honey . all right , what be your deal ?
excuse me ?

yeah ? so ?
wow ! you really be a piece of work . it 's not enough you get the prom queen , you have to get the head of the decorate committee , too ?
what be you talk about ?
do n't play innocent with me . i practically invent use fancy lab equipment to seduce woman .
have it ever work ?
not so far , but that 's not the point !
howard , relax , i 'm not interested in your girlfriend .
i hope not , because you do n't want to mess with me . i 'm crazy .
i believe you .
research journal , entry one . i 'm about to embark on one of the great challenge of my scientific career , teach penny physic . i 'm call it project gorilla .
hey , sheldon .
come in . take a seat . subject have arrive . i 've extend a friendly casual greet .
ready to get start ?
one moment . subject appear well-rested and enthusiastic . apparently , ignorance be bliss . all right , let u begin . where 's your notebook ?
um , i do n't have one .
how be you go to take note without a notebook ?
i have to take note ?
how else be you gon na study for the test ?
there 's gon na be a test ?
test . here . it 's college-ruled . i hope that 's not too intimidate .
thank you .
yeah , give or take . a i be say , it 's a warm summer even in ancient greece yes , penny ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
ca n't you hold it ?
not for twenty six hundred year .
project gorilla , entry two . i be exhaust .
huh ?
oh , that explains a lot .
howard , i 'm home !
of course .
senior fitness be cancel . it turn out you can forget how to ride a bike . i 'm fine , but , oy , do sam harpootian eat gravel .
what 's great about an 80-year-old armenian man with half his chin scrap off ?
no , no , do n't move . hey , ma , can i have lamb stew for dinner ?
lamb stew ? i 'd have to go to the supermarket .
oh , i ca n't say no to my little tushy face . i 'll be back soon .
thanks , ma .
always le seur pea with lamb stew !
you 're right ! when you 're right , you 're right ! what if they 're out of the le seur ?
then get the regular !
all right ! you do n't have to yell !
sorry about that .
uh , what do you mean ?
really ? he say that ?
me ? no . i may have mention that it 's a little inappropriate to be ask another man 's girlfriend to his experiment without first discuss it with say man .
sorry .
now , if ma equal mg what do that imply ?
i do n't know .
how can you not know ? i just told you . have you suffer a recent blow to the head ?
hey ! you do n't have to be so mean !
i 'm sorry . have you suffer a recent blow to the head ?
no , you just suck at teach .
really ? of those two explanation , which one seem the most likely ?
oh , god , sheldon , look i 'm try to understand , but you 're go too fast . can you just back up a little bit ?
all right . it 's a warm summer even in ancient greece
not that far back !
okay ! at what point do you begin to feel lose ?
i do n't know . where be we look up at the night sky ?
greece .
there 's no need to get frustrate , people learn at different rate . unlike object fall in a vacuum , which ? ma equal mg ?
square ?
no .
aristotle ?
no .
five ?
oh !
then i do n't know .
why be you cry ?
because i 'm stupid !
that 's no reason to cry . one cry because one be sad . for example , i cry because others be stupid and it make me sad .
okay , look , can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what leonard do ?
all right . leonard be attempt to learn why sub-atomic particle move the way they do .
really ? that 's it ? well , that do n't sound so complicate .
okay , i just have one question . what exactly be sub-atomic particle ?
a good question .
thank you .
and to answer it , we first must ask ourselves , what be physic ?
oh , ball .
okay , i get a bone to pick with you .
what do i do now ?
i be in bed with bernadette , and you text-blocked me .
what ?
we be completely naked , about to devour each other when , you text her that i have a problem with her hang out with you .
you do have a problem with her hang out with me .
yeah , but that 's not what you tell her .
i do n't know , something that do n't make me come off a a petty , jealous douche .
and what would that be ?
come on , do i have to think of everything ?
hi .
same thing you 're do here . i come to see leonard 's experiment .
you told her my experiment be stupid ?
i be just repeat what sheldon say . let 's not get off topic , bernadette , i need to apologize . i be wrong to tell you who you should be friend with .
should i , um , leave you two alone ?
okay , good , 'cause i be n't really gon na go .
look , i know i come off a confident and worldly , but the truth be i 'm not .
we 're shock .
which be why i tend to feel threaten by other guy .
but i now realize how foolish that be .
he have a panic attack once when he get his head stuck in a sweater .
it be a full turtleneck . why be n't you help me ?
i do n't know . maybe because i 'm crazy ?
bernadette , please , i 'm ask you to give me another chance .
tushy face , that be go on twitter right now .
i 'm glad you enjoy it . most people be n't that interested in what i do .
tear seem appropriate . enlargement of the heart muscle , or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , be a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure .
fa-la-la , la-la-la , la-la-la .
you really do n't like it , sheldon ?
we do n't have a tree when i be grow up .
really ? why not ?
oh , sound festive . do you at least give present ?
sheldon , what about you ? do you have a christmas tree ?
i do not . but if you insist on decorate a spider-infested fire hazard in my home i would request that you add this .
what be it ?
you 're kid , right ? it 's a bust of sir isaac newton .
wait , excuse me , but it 's much more christmassy than anything you 've put on the tree .
here we go .
i sense that 's not sincere , although i have no idea why .
no , he do n't .
i understand . you dispute newton 's claim that he invent calculus and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top .
yeah , you get me . i 'm a leibniz man .
well , perhaps when your mother get here , she 'll talk some sense into you .
what ? your your mother 's come ? when ?
tomorrow .
when be you go to tell me ?
why be you keep this a secret ?
well , i just , i thought
why would n't she approve of me ? i 'm adorable .
you be , it 's just
i know . and those special , they change every day .
okay , you know what ? it 's lame when i say it , it 's just ridiculous when you pile on .
okay , sorry .
so what do she say when you told her we be go out ?
um
you do n't tell her we be go out , do you ?
um
why not ?
um
leonard , i 'm no expert on meditation , but if you 're try to calm yourself down , i believe the word be om .
no trouble at all .
i drove , mother . i 'm drive now .
my pleasure . for a non-physicist , you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipole in the brain 's water molecule could not possibly form a bose condensate .
wait , wait , wait . when do you send my mom note on a paper ?

my bad . i do send a gift from both of u .
you must be very happy .
well , i 'm not sure about interest , but

no , really . i have a girlfriend now .
she have to go out of town . her grandmother die .
i do n't know what you 're talk about .

so , why be it no longer a specialty ? do the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself ? and look over here , shrimp in mobster sauce . what be mobster sauce ?
it 's obviously a typo .
perhaps . perhaps this restaurant 's now a front for organize crime . for all we know , the mobster sauce contains actual chunk of decease mobster .

you know what ? let 's just get a pizza .
good idea . we 'll go to corleone 's .

you know , the more i think about it , the mobster sauce could n't possibly contain chunk of mobster .

i 'm not crazy . my mother have me test .
oh , my goodness . where do i begin ? for instance , my laptop contain four out of the five gedanken experiment necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem .
how be that go to help them ?
well , they could monitor scientific publication and see if anyone post such a cogent restatement in the next couple of month . if so , the author be most likely in possession of my steal laptop .
what be we suppose to do now ?
the only thing we can do . watch tv on our phone until the criminal return and bludgeon u to death in our sleep .
do that mean you 've rule me out a a suspect ?
oh , how i wish i could .
i do not have to urinate . i be the master of my own bladder . drat .

excellent . go on .
the reason that date be , like , so totally fix in my memory be that i have the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic act i 've ever see in , like , ever .
why , you do , sir . you . dr sheldon cooper , and may i add , it be a privilege to know you .
there 's no need for compliment , this court be only interested in the fact .
only a suggestion . a catch in your throat would work just a well .
but it be a fact that it 's a privilege to know you . totally .
maybe you should put on your juicy pant again .
good morning , your honour . dr sheldon cooper appear in pro se . that be to say , represent himself .
and yet you wound up in traffic court . anyway , if it would please the court , i 'd like to begin with an opening statement .
thank you .
i object . you 're completely ignore the law .
really ? i would point out that i be at the top of my profession , while you preside over the kiddy table of yours .
i be a scientist . i never apologize for the truth .
that 's my spot .
i ca n't wait to ask stan lee why he insists on give all his character first and last name that start with the same letter .
oh , come on , why would you do that ?
bruce banner , reed richards , sue storm , stephen strange , otto octavius , silver surfer , peter parker , oh , and bad of all , j jonah jameson , jr .
okay , i 'm cut . i 'm not gon na talk to stan lee after you cheese him off .
hey .
sheldon 's in jail .
sheldon 's in jail ?
you call it .
for what ?
what do you think ? for do the same crap he always do , except to a judge . he have to stay in there until he apologizes .
so tell him to apologize .
oh , gee , thanks , leonard . that do n't occur to me . if he do n't apologize by _ o'clock he be go to spend the night in jail .
oh , no , that 's terrible . ooh , the line 's move . get to go . bye .
excuse me ? excuse me , jailor ?
i need to use the restroom .

okay , that 's enough , howard . the poor guy 's have a tough time . he have to spend the entire afternoon in jail wear that suit .
you 're right , so it would be cruel to mention that after he finish signing autograph , stan lee take stuart and u out for gelato .
you have gelato with stan lee ?
he say we could call him stan .
except for raj .
well , i hope you 're satisfied , penny . you be responsible for all the evil that have befallen me today .
okay , i realize that
not finish . it be because of you that i now have a criminal record , and it be because of you that i miss out on have gelato with stan lee .

anyway , we follow the guy to this garage sale , and they have the coolest stuff .
they be closing up . we get this whole box for sixty buck .
we do n't even get to go through it all . there could be anything in here .
there a new girlfriend in there ? ‘ cause you might need one .
no . but there be an original final draft ghostbusters script with actual slime stain ! oh , you 're right , it 's ghostbusters _ . never mind .
no , what 's sad be that you do n't know adam west be tv 's batman .
okay , bye .
okay .
ooh , look , an indiana jones connect-the-dots .
look like someone drew a penis on him .
huh ? that 'll come off .
you see what you 're do ? stop that .
what ?
it appear to be a lord of the ring ring .
oh .
it 's even get the elvish engrave on it .
it 's not elvish . it 's the language of mordor write in elvish script . one ring to rule them all .
one ring to find them .
one ring to bring them all .
and in the darkness bind them .
holy crap , be we nerdy .
so , i be do some check on the ring .
hold on . sheldon , be there ketchup on that table ?
you know , your black market phasers , your screen-worn lieutenant uhura panty , that kind of stuff .
who 's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have ?
just a guy . i know a guy .
be it eddie crispo ?
no , i ca n't tell you who it be . stop ask .
who else could it be ? it have to be eddie crispo .
i know lot of dangerous people , okay ?
name one .
eddie crispo . anyway , he say this be n't a replica . it 's the real deal .
if you 're suggest that that be the actual ring of power forge by sauron in mount doom , i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement .
he 's not say it 's a magic ring . you 're not , be you ?
no , it be not yours . we all go in on the box together .
well , yes , but i found it in the box , and the law of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure be the owner of the treasure .
how be this maritime salvage ?
other than the lack of water , how be it not ?
wait , wait . sheldon , stop be crazy for a second . how much be something like this worth ?
well , it 's tough to say since it 's hot , but on the underground market , my guy figure
your guy eddie crispo ?
okay , that 's a lot of money . the wise thing to do be invest it in something practical . like a jet ski .
why do you want a jet ski ?
all the wealthy and beautiful people in movie ride jet ski . that ca n't just be a coincidence .
we ca n't sell it . we have to keep it and love it and polish it , and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scene from the movie .
it 's sad how great that sound .
guy , it 's steal . it should go back to peter jackson . he make the movie , it belongs to him .
clearly , you 've never be to my house for dinner on rosh hashanah .
we be not blackmailing peter j all right , where 's the ring ?
you mean my ring ?
what be you do ?
the ring be unguarded , it be just sit on the table , anyone could have take it . proof ? i do .
give me that .
look , let 's be reasonable . we all want to do different thing with the ring , but your idea be stupid , and i want a jet ski .
i found it . the ring be mine . i do n't understand why in this group i never get my way .
i 'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring .
hey , guy . enjoy your food that i actually brought you instead of promising food , but bring you a box of random crap ?
yeah , it 's delicious , the sarcasm 's a little stale , though . hey , how about this ? until we figure out what to do with the ring , penny hold on to it .
what ring ?
this ring .
look for something ?
will you hold on to this for a couple of day ?
it 's a prop from a movie , and we 're kind of fight over it .
okay , just to be clear , the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend give me be a prop from a movie , and i do n't even get to keep it ?
if you have go out with me three year ago , by now , you 'd have my great aunt ida 's brooch that she smuggle out of occupy belgium in a cat .
how be i look now ?
ow ! you hit me ! i 'm bleeding !
what be that ?
sheldon try to take the ring and i punch him .
so , sheldon , how 's it feel to get beaten up by a girl ?

i be afraid of that . go ahead .
also my cousin .

we 're not give him two jet ski .
no jet ski .
forget the jet ski ? that be our line in the sand ! what happen to “ tear them a new one ? ”
you 're useless .
i 'm signing off now .
okay , just so you know , if we 're bring in cousin who be lawyer , prepare for shock and awe .
you mean this ring ? next time be aware of your surroundings while urinate in a public men 's room .
give me that .

you do realize there 's a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the syfy channel .
wait , my laptop .
you know , there 's a point when this becomes idiotic .
and it be n't when we be drive like this ?
i would advise the three of you that resistance be futile . i have endless patience . i once spent two-and-a-half hour on hold with hewlett-packard customer service just to complain about their customer service .
you want to talk about endless patience ? penny make me watch all five season of sex and the city .
there be six season , dude .

will you be quiet ?
well , if you want privacy let go of the ring . i 'm so glad we come to this gentile strip club ! howard , here 's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa 's g-string !
if you 're offend , let go of the ring and go on home to your mother 's booby .
excellent , excellent . tire each other out , the ring will be mine . howard , why do n't you go after raj 's mother ?
why do n't we go after your mother ?
you 're right . let 's talk about your grandmother .
no ! i call no meemaws .
think about this . the only way your mother be born be your meemaw have sex .
i do n't want to hear this .
then let go of the ring and walk away .
never .

stop it !
yeah , meemaw do the nasty .
i say stop it !

subliminal message . i 'm go to make you want to pee . drip faucet . leaky gutter . pee .
it 's , it 's not work , dude .
oh-ho-ho , it 's work all right . i have to pee .
then let go of the ring and go .
no , actually , i would n't mind go , too .
fine . um , on the count of three . one , two
wait , just to clarify . when you get to three , do we stand up or do we pee ?
we stand up .
excellent choice .
three .
something tell me this be a bad day to wear suede shoe .
the fire of mount doom ?
peter jackson 's office in new zealand . it be n't ours .
you quit the game ! you have no right to take it .
i come in here , you guy be all sleep . the ring be on the floor . no one be touch it .
well , so then we start the game over until there 's a winner .
never !
ugh , get ta go back to date dumb guy from the gym .
okay in avatar when they have sex in pandora they hook up their ponytail , so we know their ponytail be like their junk .
yeah , so ?
so , when they ride horse and fly on the bird , they also use their ponytail .
what 's your point ?
my point be , if i be a horse or a bird , i 'd be very nervous around james cameron .
it amazes me how you constantly ob over fictional detail when there be more important thing in the real world to worry about . for example , why be n't william shatner in the new star trek movie ?
hey , sheldon , i be up in the administration office , and i happen to overhear the name of the winner of this year 's chancellor 's award for science .
i won ?
you won .
yeah , the one thing the william shatner of theoretical physic need be an ego boost .
no .
hey , you do n't want a slurpee at 7-eleven , you do n't get glass .
oh , that will be another congratulatory call for me . uh , mute , please .
they expect me to give a speech at the banquet . i ca n't give a speech .
well , no , you 're mistaken . you give speech all the time . what you ca n't do be shut up .
yeah , before the movie , you do _ minute on why guacamole turn brown . it turn brown while you be talk .
i be perfectly comfortable speak to small group . i can not speak to large crowd .
any group big enough to trample me to death . general rule of thumb be _ adult or _ child .
sheldon , congratulation . brought you cheesecake from work . you know , 'cause of your award , not because a busboy sneeze on it .
i 'm not accept the award .
why not ?
turn out the great sheldon cooper have stage fright .
sheldon , you 're be ridiculous .
i be _ and graduate summa cum laude from college . summa cum laude be latin for with high honour .
i just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks .
sheldon ? sheldon , be you okay ?
do n't trample me .
be i in trouble ? do my mother call you ?
just sit .
we think we can help you with your stage fright .
oh , i doubt that . i have n't figure out a way , and i 'm much smarter than all of you .
yes , but you 're not smarter than all of u put together .
okay , your problem be , you 're try to do this all by yourself .
we can help you . we can be your team . like , uh , professor xavier and his x-men .
i do like the x-men .
yeah , we watch it last week . you say you like it .
oh . i say a lot of thing , sweetie . so , how about it , sheldon ?
i do n't know . if you 're my x-men , what be your power ?
that 's not exactly a mutation that would get you into xavier 's school for gift youngster , but go on . leonard ?
i thought i could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety .
my mother be a highly regard psychiatrist , and i 've be in therapy ever since she accuse me of breast-feeding co-dependently .
raj say he can teach you , what do you call it ? i do n't know , some indian meditation crap .
i see . well , i assume , since the rest of you have set the bar so low , you 're save the most impressive contribution for last . go ahead , howard . dazzle me .
my power be the ability to pretend like i give a damn about your piddly-ass problem . and that 's _ , buddy .
and i appreciate the pretence .
so , what do you say , sheldon ? be we your x-men ?
no . the x-men be name for the x in charles xavier . since i be sheldon cooper , you will be my c-men .
oh , that 's not a good name .
okay , sheldon . i 'm go to be lead you through a series of meditation exercise . these method come from the ancient guru of india and have help me overcome my own fear .
and yet , you ca n't speak to woman .
true , but thanks to meditation , i be able to stay in the same room with them without urinate . now , close your eye .
what ?
when i be little , my sister would say to me , close your eye , you 'll get a surprise , and then she 'd punch me .
i 'm not go to punch you .
that 's what my sister use to say .
do you want to do this or not ?
i 'm sorry . proceed .
all right . imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home . where be that ?
sim city . more specifically , the sim city i design , sheldonopolis .
okay , you 're in sheldonopolis .
where exactly ? sheldon square ? sheldon tower ? sheldon stadium , home of the fight sheldons ?
whatever you like .
i thought this be suppose to be a guide meditation .
fine . you 're in sheldon square .
really ? this time of year ? it 's a bit nippy .
then , put on a sweater .
suppose i could run downtown and pick up something at shel-mart .
you know , the nice thing about shel-mart be i own it , so i get a _ % discount .
you own the damn thing . just take a freak sweater !

this be great . i have a suit like this when i be six . okay , i think we have a winner .
where the hell d'you find that ?
in the prom department .
it 's ridiculous .
say the former member of the corn queen 's court .
please just try this one on .
okay . but anything i put on now be only go to suffer in comparison . this be absurd . i look like a clown .
so , sheldon , how you do ?
would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dream ?
um , i do n't know , maybe .
i recently have a dream that i be a giant . but everything around me be to scale , so it all look normal .
how do you know you be a giant if everything be to scale ?
i be wear size a million pant .
why do n't we just talk ?
terrible . i work really hard on that project . i stayed up all night sing the clown 's aria from pagliacci to a lima bean sprout .

damn right , i 'm angry with my mother . for god 's sake , i be eight year old . she humiliate me . that 's when the bed-wetting start again .
thank you , leonard .
for what ?
if someone a damage a you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning , i think i can face a simple award ceremony .
wait , that 's it ? i thought we have a whole hour !
what 's the matter ?
i 'm get dizzy .
do n't worry . you 're surround by your c-men .
i ca n't do this . i 'm go to faint .
here , drink this . it 'll relax you .
alcohol ? i do n't drink alcohol .

here , see if this one work .
oh , right . lady and gentleman , our guest of honour , dr sheldon cooper .
sure .
question one , where be my pant ?
you might want to check youtube .
what do i search ?
it 's already load . just hit play .
uh-uh , give it a minute .
now , for the astronomer in the audience , get ready to see the dark side of the moon . and here 's uranus .
have a little trouble catch your breath there ?
no , no , i 'm good . if my p.e . teacher have told me this be what i be training for , i would have try a lot harder .
do or do not . there be no try .

hey , leonard , where do you come down on giant ant ?
what 's with him ?
perhaps he 's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle .
be you say he 's man-struating ?
not literally . but a far back a the 17th century , scientist observe a 33-day fluctuation in men 's hormone level .
interest . that might explain my weepy day in the middle of the month . you know what i 'm talk about .
okay , forget giant ant . how about giant rabbit ?
big or small , i do n't like rabbit . they always look like they 're about to say something , but they never do .
rabbit do have a respiratory system that would support great size . and on a side note , they be one of the few mammal whose scrotum be in front of the penis .
maybe that 's what they want to talk about .
leonard , where do you stand on giant rabbit and scrotal position ?
i honestly do n't care .
really ? because every time we 've talk about unusual animal genitals , you 've always have some pretty strong and controversial opinion .
what do you want from me ? i just do n't give a rat 's as .
would that be a giant rat 's as ?
for the record , giant rat be possible .
can we please talk about something else ? maybe something vaguely related to life a we know it on this planet ?
okay , how about this for a topic , why be leonard be a giant douche ? assume giant douche be possible .
of course they be . leonard 's be one .
maybe he 's have a lover 's spat with penny .
no , there be no spat .
oh , but something happen .
i do n't want to talk about it .
but i sense you 're go to and i do n't want to hear about it . excuse me .
what 'd you do , romeo ? you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she be in the mood for a short stack ?
do you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panty and jump around , but it wound up just creep her out ?
what ? no .
i 'm just ask , dude . it happens .
that be what be refer to a a burn on you .
do you ask her to start wax ?
no .
do you start wax ?
no .
while make love , do you accidentally spank your own as and cry out mommy ?
i 'm walk away from you now .
that be n't a no .
yeah , i think we 're get close .
do you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her ? because you can die that way .
oh , that would be a good way to go .
hi .
oh , hey .
good , penny , reminder , bowling tonight at seven o'clock .
oh , right , bowling .
you do n't have to come if you do n't want to .
no , no , it 's okay . i mean , let 's face it , you guy would get cream without me .
we would indeed . in this particular case , your lack of femininity work to our advantage .
it 's always nice chat with you , sheldon .
sarcasm ?
thinly veil contempt .
remember , seven o'clock .
get it .
pacific daylight time !
please reserve that butch spirit for the lane .
i thought you be bring your own bowling shoe .
these be my own bowling shoe .
then what 's with the disinfectant ?
well , well , well . if it be n't wil wheaton , the green goblin to my spider-man , the pope paul the fifth to my galileo , the internet explorer to my firefox .
i 'm the proud owner of wil wheaton stink dot com , dot net , and dot org . what do that tell you ?
oh , foolish wil wheaton , it be never off .
i 'm sure you 're probably sick of star trek question , but , whoopi goldberg , you ever hit that ?
ah , beer . the magic elixir that can turn this poor , shy indian boy into the life of the party . oh , yeah .
chilli cheese fry ?
yes . i love chilli cheese fry .
really ? you love them ?
yeah , why ?
no reason . i 'm just glad to hear you 're comfortable say you love something .
do you really want to get into this right now ?
get into what ? why would n't you love the chilli cheese fry ? they 've be in your life a long time . they make you happy . they deserve to know .
okay , look , you just caught me by surprise last night . i do n't know what to say .
okay , well , now you 've have some time to think about it . so , what do you want to say ?
i 'm not sure .
how can you not be sure ?
okay , this be n't the place to have this conversation .
no , the place to have the conversation be in bed after i say , i love you , and you say , thank you , good night .
do n't push it , leonard .
i be not push anything .
you be . you do n't get to decide when i 'm ready to say i love you !
ah , the premature i love you .
i guess premature . do that count ?
penny , penny , penny .
what ?
this be for you .
ice cream ?
i 've be familiarize myself with female emotional crisis by study the comic strip cathy . when she 's upset , she say ach and eats ice cream .
um , ach .
if you be a cat , i would have brought you a lasagna .
do leonard send you over here ?
no , we have n't spoken since your abrupt departure last night cause u to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton .
yeah , i 'm sorry about that .
i 'm not too proud to admit that i cry myself to sleep .
again , i 'm sorry .
and let me tell you sleep do not come easily with leonard in the next room sing along with alanis morrisette .
you 're kid .
no . clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream .
all right , sheldon , what part of this be suppose to make me feel well ?
the part where i tell you i 've engineer a rematch with stuart 's team for tonight .
oh , honey , i do n't know . thing be a little weird with leonard right now .
you want me to remove him from the team ? i 'm the captain , i can do that .
no , no , that 's okay . just let me talk to him , and i 'll get back to you .
when be you go to talk to him ?
i do n't know .
he 's in the laundry room now . now would be a good time .
you 're not gon na leave me alone until i do it , be you ?
oh , i think we both know the answer to that question .
i think we should talk now .
what ? no , it 's okay . we do n't have to talk 'cause there 's nothing to talk about . everything 's good .
i 'm sorry . you know what i 'm talk about , though .
yeah , i do .
so , we 're good ?
yes , that 's what i 'm tell you . we be good . we be great .
all right ! fence mend , problem swept under the rug . time to bowl ! yes , i be eavesdropping , there 's a lot at stake here .
attention , all bowler . i 've take the liberty of have these make for our rematch .
no , not the wesley crusher . the wesley “ crusher . ”
i do n't get it .
wesley crusher be wil wheaton 's character on star trek .
still do n't get it .
it 's a blindingly clever play on word . by appropriate his character 's name and add the s , we imply that we we 'll be the crusher of wesley .
okay , i 'm sorry , honey , but the wesley crusher sound like a bunch of people who like wesley crusher .
you know , if you want it to mean you 're crush wesley , it 'd be the “ wesley ” crusher .
do you people even hear yourselves ? it 's not the wesley crusher . it 's not the “ wesley ” crusher . it 's the wesley “ crusher . ”
no , it 's not the never mind .
oh , yes . the loser will be publicly humiliate in a fashion to be chosen by the victor . fyi , i plan on have you publish a scientific paper expound the discredit velikovsky hypothesis .
oh , yes ? well , before i respond , let me ask you a question . be your mother a good or poor bowler ?
no , after you , a we be currently crush you , wesley .
all right .
i so loathe you .
that 's not even from your franchise !
thank you , stuart . it 's nice to know .
leave me alone , sheldon .
you be n't the ball .
hey , thanks .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm , and someday , we do n't know when , maybe you 'll love me back . ooh , i 'm up .
excuse me . i do n't know who you 're chant for a i be currently the ball .
thank you , jesus ! a my mother would say .
oh , yeah , me , too .
tell me about it .
oh , i 'm sorry .
really ?
do you let wil wheaton get in your head ?
what be you talk about ?
he 's evil . he play evil mind game . do he tell you his grandmother die ?
no !
well , if he do , do n't believe it . he 's not above play the dead meemaw card .
enjoy the accolade now , wil wheaton , but like your time on star trek : next generation , your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived .
penny , you 're up .
all right , remember , his meemaw 's alive and be the ball .
yeah , i get it .
we really need a strike here .
so just take your time and concentrate .
yeah , you be ! just back off !
okay , i 'm sorry . i 'll shut up .
i do n't mean shut up .
fine . just tell me what to do , and i 'll do it .
no , this be n't fair to you , leonard . i 'm sorry .
no , let her go .
be you insane ? if she leaf , it 's over !
i 'm pretty sure it 's already over .
no , i suppose not .
wheaton !
sheldon , you 're wrong . wolverine be not born with bone claw .
howard , you know me to be a very smart man . do n't you think if i be wrong , i 'd know it ?
okay , first of all
i 'm not crazy . my mother have me test .
hey , guy .
what be you do here ?
what do you mean ? it 's new comic book night .
yeah , but since you and penny finally hooked up , we thought you two would be have bouncy naked yum-yum night .
okay , who have leonard flame out with penny in less than _ hour ” ?
i do .
you do n't have to , but it 's highly recommend .
yeah , take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slam shut on your little dinky .
it 's not a matter of opportunity . we 're get to know each other . there 's a learn curve .
what 's there to learn ? you get naked , do nasty thing to each other , then somebody make scramble egg and salami . easy peasy .
perhaps what leonard be obliquely refer to be the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction .
oh , a clever , albeit obsolete , euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ .
nothing like that happen , all right ? the sex be just fine .
just fine ? oh , dude , the fourth harry potter movie be just fine .
i 'm not say it be bad , i 'm just say it be n't great .
okay , when you say “ it be n't great , do you mean for both of you ? because we can totally see it not be great for her . be i right ?
oh , yeah .
to tell you the truth , i think we be both a little , i do n't know
disappointed ? let down ?
ashamed ? horrify ? repulse ?
all i know be , it be n't the way i dream it would be .
sex be never the way i dream it 's gon na be .
that 's because in your dream you 're a horse from the waist down .
tandoori palace ?
no , we go somewhere new .
you 're good-naturedly rib me , be n't you ?
no , look , mumbai palace .
why ? why would we change ? we have a perfectly good palace . tandoori palace be our palace .
trust me , this will be just fine .
you be the authority on just fine .
what 's that suppose to mean ?
yeah , exactly . not bad , but not great .
what be they talk about ?
i know . a i 'm sure you 're aware
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh .
penny , wait . aagh ! what be wrong with you ?
i sense i may have cross some sort of line .
yeah , you
uh , no , no , no , do n't tell him , let 's see if he can figure it out .
please do n't be mad .
what do you tell them ?
nothing bad , just that last night be fine .
okay ?
no .
okay-dokay .
you know , i think this be one of those thing where talk about it be not go to make it well . want a glass of wine ?
so much .
actually , ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cell and stimulates reuptake receptor of inhibitory neurotransmitter like gamma-aminobutyric acid .
do n't talk , just drink .
no , you 're misunderstand . a shiksa goddess be n't an actual goddess and we do n't pray to them , we prey on them .
whatever , dude . the point be , leonard 's get one and you do n't .
be this it ? it be inappropriate to discus leonard and penny 's sex life in front of leonard and penny . oh , good ! now i can eat .
sound like a cricket .
hang on . base on the number of chirp per minute and the ambient temperature in this room , it be a snowy tree cricket .
oh , give me a frickin ' break . how could you possibly know that ?
under the term of my roommate agreement with leonard , i 've have unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of _ .
okay , you be right about wolverine and bone claw , but you 're wrong about the cricket .
howard , do n't embarrass yourself , the science chirp for itself . humorous word play .
that be a snowy tree cricket . oecanthus fultoni . i be do with latin by fifth grade .
okay , okay , tell you what . i be willing to bet anything that 's an ordinary field cricket .
i ca n't take your money .
what 's the matter , you chicken ?
thank god .
okay , i believe a chicken make you his bitch . but the cricket thing , i do n't buy . bet me .
fair enough . what stake do you propose ?
i will put up my fantastic four number _ , first appearance of silver surfer against your flash _ , the classic flash of two world issue .
all right , you have a wager .
hmm .
great . now how be you go to settle it , hmm ? there be no way to determine the specie of the cricket without examine it .
i wonder what the non-pathetic people be do tonight .
more wine ?
hit me .
i do n't see anything .
shh !
hallway .
my stomach . indian food do n't agree with me . ironic , be n't it ?
shh ! elevator shaft .
help me open it .
be you crazy ? we ca n't go down an empty elevator shaft .
fine , if you do n't want to proceed , then you forfeit the bet , and i 'll take possession of your fantastic four .
let 's open her up .
be you bother that i can so easily manipulate you ?
do n't push me , sheldon . i may be small , but i take kung fu when i be _ , and i remember a good deal of it .
what be we drinking now ?
peppermint schnapps .
why would you buy peppermint schnapps ?
because i like peppermint , and it 's fun to say schnapps . hey , leonard ?
what ?
schnapps .
schnapps . you 're right , that be fun .
be careful .
if i be not be careful , your tell me to be careful would not make me careful .
uh-oh , flashlight go out . i need some battery . fella ? hello ? it 's really dark down here .
oh , sweetie . you really ca n't hold your liquor , can you ?
i 'm okay . just a little mouthwash , and then i 'm gon na rock your world . be you okay ?
ugh , toby , what do you do in a past life to be so disgust now ?
his name be n't toby . toby be an absurd name for a cricket .
an appropriate cricket name . for example , jiminy .
that be not toby , this be toby . raj , what do you think ?
oh , i really do n't care anymore
god , i have the most horrible night .
what happen ?
obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess .
shiksa . shik-sa .
forgive me . yiddish be not spoken in east texas . and if it be , it be n't spoken for long .
yeah , fine , whatever . the point be , you 're wrong again .
we have n't establish that i 'm wrong once .
he 's a snowy tree cricket , and his name be jiminy .
i bet i could throw a rock in this room and come up with three well friend .
holy crap . it 's like silence of the lamb down here . do n't do that !
yeah , well , i do n't like bug , okay ? they freak me out .
interest . you 're afraid of insect and woman . ladybug must render you catatonic . it be a joke . i make it to lessen your discomfort . you 're welcome
i 'm dr cooper from the physic department .
i 'm sorry ?
no , you do n't understand . we just want to ask you a question .
i 'm from new delhi . maybe you should find another entomologist .
told you .
yes !
no , no , wait . dr crawley , be you sure ?
cruel a that may be , that be not in itself a credential .
enjoy oxnard . i 'm sure your daughter 's look forward to have you .
old comic book . i just retrieve it from my safe deposit box .
what do you have a safe deposit box for ?
old comic book . i lose this to wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager .
what , do they have wii cricket now ? that ca n't be very popular .
penny , i 'd rather not talk about it .
well , if it make you feel any well , i 'm not feel so hot either .
why would that make me feel well ?
i do n't know , empathy ? anyway , i 'm just say that you 're feel upset about something with howard , and i 'm upset about something with leonard .
a chicken that be own by mr riley .
okay , forget the chicken .
well , i wish i could .
no , no . you may be right about me and leonard .
of course i 'm right what be the odds i 'd be wrong twice in one week ?
no , i mean , we can always go back to be friend .
i just say that . this conversation have start to circle . meeting adjourn .
hello .
hey . what 's go on ?
leonard , it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial . i lose a bet to wolowitz .
right , right . you 're say you talk to penny ?
yes .
interest .
hardly .
excuse me .
have i cross some sort of line again ?
hmm . oh , who care ?
hey . uh , what do sheldon say to you ?
not a lot . just that we always have the option of go back to be friend .
be that what you want ?
i do n't know . i mean , you have to admit thing seem simpler when we be just friend .
i guess .
it would take the pressure off .
it would , would n't it ?
so , we 'll just be friend .
come here .
okay-dokay
oh , damn , they cancel my visa . oh , yay , a new mastercard !
uh-oh .
what ?
i be go to get my mail .
okay . be , be you hop to get it telepathically ?
i think you mean telekinetically . and no , i just be n't sure of the proper protocol now that you and leonard be no longer have coitus .
god , can we please just say no longer see each other ?
well , we could if it be true . but a you live in the same building , you see each other all the time . the variable which have change be the coitus .
okay , here 's the protocol , you and i be still friend , and you stop say coitus .
good , good . i 'm glad we 're still friend .
really ?
oh , yes . it be a lot of work to accommodate you in my life . i 'd hate for that effort to have be in vain .
right .
just to be clear do i have to stop say coitus with everyone or just you ?
everyone .
great .
so , how you be ?
you 're just coitusing with me , be n't you ?
bazinga .
mmm . how 's leonard do ?
i 'd rather you pretend i do n't say it . i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce .
that 's the sauce my mother us . she like cooking italian because accord to her , that 's what the roman make jesus eat .
interest . i 'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night .
i 'm hungry now .
oh . um , okay . why do n't you give me an hour and come over ?
will you cut up hot dog into little chunk and mix them in with the sauce ?
i do n't have hot dog .

hey , where you be ?
i be talk with penny .
what 's wrong with you ? you ca n't hang out with your roommate 's ex . that 's totally uncool .
no , no , it 's fine . i do n't care . i 'm over it .
yeah , he 's over it , that 's why he 's be whine all day about try to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from men in black .
be he make any progress ? because i 'd like to erase ben affleck a daredevil .
so would ben affleck . the point be , in a situation like this you get to pick side . you 're either on team leonard or team penny .
what ?
well , usually i 'm on the team that pick last . unless there 's a kid in a wheelchair .
sheldon , i get you your tangerine chicken . i hope you 're hungry .
well , of course i 'm hungry . and a i have no plan to eat with any other team , i will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto . mm , mm , mm !

why do n't you ask her to come up ?
i do n't know , it 's still a little weird since , you know
she do n't dump me . we be just in different place in the relationship .
i fail to see how a relationship can have the quality of a geographic location .
screw you guy . i 'm gon na go see if she 's home .
if it 's not too much trouble , i 'd like to point this at the moon now .
wait a second , the good wife be cry . something 's very wrong .

sheldon , do n't ruin the game .

this be a restaurant . it 's lunchtime . i would think , a a waitress , you 'd be familiar with the paradigm .
be leonard come ?
no , i believe leonard be wait for you to come crawl back to him and apologize .
well , that 's not gon na happen .
i assume that would be your attitude . hence , my true purpose in come here .
which be ?
i want you to crawl back to him and apologize .
i 'm busy .
excuse me , miss . i 'd like to order lunch .
fine . what do you want ?
i have a few question . first , i notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich ?
yes .
where exactly do the half-sandwich come from ? be you give me half of someone else 's sandwich , or do i have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half ?
no , no , sheldon , they just make a half-sandwich .
you ca n't make a half-sandwich . if it 's not half of a whole sandwich , it 's just a small sandwich .
okay , fine , it 's soup and a small sandwich . be that what you want ?
of course not . i 'll have my usual .

well , i 'm sorry , sheldon , but this really be n't about you .
i do n't follow .
yeah , yeah , i 'll be right there . look , sheldon , i have to go .
all right , let 's assume , ad argumentum , that in this case , leonard be wrong .
leonard be wrong .
consider the number of transgression you 've commit that he 's overlook , do n't you think that , just this once , you could return the favour ?
be you under the impression that leonard have no complaint about you ?
your drive , the plethora of stuffed animal on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activity , your constant tardiness , your sing .
my sing ?
that 's actually from my list , but leonard would be a fool if he do n't agree with it .
okay , if leonard have so many problem with me , why have n't he just say so ?
because , accord to him , you 're oversensitive and have a temper .
oh , really ? well , then , do me a favour and tell leonard that he can drop dead !
and she wonder why she 's constantly undertipped .
hey .
oh , good , you 're home . i need you to do me a favour .
sure .
go apologize to penny .
right now would be good .
leonard !
although , a few minute ago would have be well .
what ? who would tell you something like that ? why would you tell her something like that ?
it do n't matter why he told me . it 's true , be n't it ?
oh , come on . sheldon , have you ever once heard me say that i do n't trust penny ? sheldon ? where do he go ?

why do n't you say so ?
oh , now i need your permission for that , too ? !
well , i ca n't read your mind , penny !

i ca n't ! i 'm on the toilet !
for god 's sake , i do n't need to hear that ! ca n't you just say , i 'm busy ?

so what do justin say when you told him he could n't sleep on your couch ?
he 's a musician . he 'll sleep in his own vomit , if he have to .
i should have ask for much more than a comic book and a robot .
how much time do we have ?
uh , t-minus five hour , _ minute to onset of meteor shower .
okay , our position be _ degree north , _ west . that mean the azimuth should be _ degree relative to magnetic north with an elevation of _ .

hi , guy .
hey .

yo , raj , talk to me . i 'm sorry , just screw with you . hey , howard , why have n't you call bernadette ?
do she say something ?
yeah , she say she have n't heard from you in a week . i thought you like her ?
i do , yeah , but she want a commitment and i 'm not sure she 's my type .
she agree to go out with you for free . what more do you need ?
look , bernadette be really nice . i just always thought when i finally settle down into a relationship , it would be with someone , you know , different .
different how ?
well , you know , more like megan fox from transformer , or katee sackhoff from battlestar galactica .
be you high ?
you 'd have a well shot with the three-breasted martian hooker from total recall .
okay , now you 're just be unrealistic . anyway , that movie be like _ year ago , imagine how saggy those thing would be .
howard , you 're go to throw away a great girl like bernadette because you 're hold out for some ridiculous fantasy ?
hey , just because you settle do n't mean i have to .
excuse me , i 'm sit here .
hey , i do not settle for leonard . i mean , obviously , he be n't the kind of guy i usually go out with , you know , physically .
my point be , i do not judge a book by it cover . i be interested in the person underneath .
i be here , right ? you see me .
excuse me , may i interject ?
what ?
biologically speak , howard be perfectly justified in seek out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line .
thank you , sheldon .
now , whether that propagation be in the interest of humanity be , of course , an entirely different question .
my pleasure , ira .
no , i hear you fine . a i be say , an ordinary magnet have two pole . the primary characteristic of a monopole be that it have only one pole , hence , monopole .
come on , katee , do n't make it sound so cheap .
thank you . so , shall we get start ?
you want to play cylon and colonist ?
you mean , bernadette ?
i know , but she 's not you .
really ? tall ?
ouch .
howard ! what be you do in there ?
i 'm take a bath !
i hope that 's all you 're do ! we share that tub !
do n't remind me ! oh , man . all soap up and no place to go .

come on , it be n't that bad .
what do you want ?
we represent the lollipop guild , and we want you .
okay , so kripke played a joke on you .
i thought it be funny .
you laugh .
do you laugh ?
i fell on the floor . all right , he get you , you can get him back .
you ca n't sink . with all that helium in you , you 're lucky you do n't float away .
be you really admit defeat ?
i never admit defeat .
good .
however , on an unrelated topic , i be never get out of this bed again .
what if you could make kripke look even sillier than he make you look ?
i do n't think that 's possible , dude .
you 're not help .
i do n't come to help , i come to mock .
it 's a simple matter . there be several toxic chemical that 'd be untraceable in an autopsy .
okay , uh , that 's the spirit , but , um , let 's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance .
oh ! how about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair ? he 'll sit down , it 'll sound like he 's flatulent , even though he 's not .
let 's keep think .
oh , gee , you 're too late . scarlett johansson and wonder woman be just in here troll around for neurotic , little weasel .
yeah , i come to talk to bernadette . she 's work today , right ?
yes , but i do n't think she want to see you .
why not ?
wait , bernadette , i need to talk to you .
this will only take a second . you ask me to think about where our relationship be go , and i do . bernadette ? will you marry me ?
no . i 'm serious . i 'm never go to find another girl like you who like me and be , you know , real .
no .
i prefer to think of myself a quirky .
fair enough . when 's your break ?
do n't you just hate when this happens ?
wow .
all right , how 's this for revenge ? a solution of hydrogen peroxide , and one of saturate potassium iodide .
what 's this ?
mountain dew . ah , refresh . now , we 're go to combine these chemical with ordinary dish soap , create a little exothermic release of oxygen .
yes , exactly .
this be brilliant , sheldon . how be we go to deploy it in kripke 's office ?
you flatter me , sir .
let me guess , motion sensor ?
the reaction will be trigger when kripke reach the center of the room . mwah , ha , ha .
it may be low-tech , but i still maintain the whoopee cushion have comic validity .
here come kripke !
who be that with him ?
i believe that 's the president of the university .
and the board of director . abort ! abort !
there be no abort .
well , how could you not put in an abort ?
i make a boo-boo , all right ?
wow . look like the ganges on laundry day .
at least they do n't know it be you .
hey , here 's your tip from table seven .

i thought you broke up with her . why be she here ?
okay , here we go . passing the soy sauce . put out your hand .
oh ha-ha , oh . that 's amaze .

amy point out that between the two of u , our genetic material have the potential of produce the first in a line of intellectually superior , benign overlord to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow .

why on earth would we have sex ?

you mean date ?
yeah .
i ca n't date amy .
why not ?
she 's not my girlfriend .
okay , look , do n't think of it a date a girlfriend . think of it a , uh , get to know the future mother of your child .

a-all right , um , how about this . when , when winnie the pooh get his head stuck in the honey tree , his friend all grabbed onto him and pull and pull .
you do what you want , i 'm not touch another man 's honey tree .
all right , uh , forget pull . how about we get an electric saw and cut it off ?

that 's an amuse factoid .
thank you .
no , no . my point be , uh , tonight be sheldon 's first official date . discus .
be this true ?
apparently , a semi-incestuous teen for jesus fourth of july hoedown do n't count .
so , um , amy , what about you ? do you date much ?
your characterization of approximately _ different men a a few .
what ? where do you get _ men ?
i 'm sorry . _ ?
_ .
my mistake . now , assume the left side of a bell curve peak around the present , that would bring the total up to _ men . plus or minus eight men .
remarkable . do you have sexual intercourse with all of these men ?
no .
although that number would be fairly easy to calculate .
oh .
base on the number of awkward encounter i 've have with strange men leave her apartment in the morning , plus the number of time she 's return home wear the same clothes she wore the night before
okay , sheldon , i think you 've make your point .
so we multiply _ , minus _ men before the loss of virginity , so _ time _ give u _ sexual partner . let 's round that up to _ .
okay , sheldon , you be so wrong . that be not even close to the real number . i 'm gon na need a drink over here .
this be very interest . cultural perception be subjective . penny , to your mind , be you a slut ?
no ! no ! no . let 's just all finish our dinner , okay ?
this be an interest topic . how many sexual encounter have you have ?
do volunteer for a scientific experiment in which orgasm be achieve by electronically stimulate the pleasure centre of the brain count ?
i should think so .
then _ .
okay , come on . almost there .
next time , take your own advice .
excuse me , could you help u out ?
i slip and fell .
it 's a robot arm .
i only built the arm .
can you please just help me ?
you think you could be a little more discreet ?
uh , it 's what control the arm .
but it 's frozen .
no , you see , it 's more complicate than that . no , wait ! winnie the pooh be out of the honey tree .
now can we have cooky and hawaiian punch ?
you be right . this be a very productive even . i saw a whole new side of amy farrah fowler tonight .
i do not have sex with _ guy .
use in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny .
you 're still on that ?
in these uncertain time , do n't humanity deserve a gift ?
really ? your deeply religious born-again christian mother want a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock ?
curse .
if i 'd thought of that in the first place , i could 've save myself this whole night .
well , it 's not that late . you could still go out and look for number _ . good night .
i 've decide not to procreate .
yeah , yeah , great . howard , uh , slow down . what do you mean it happen again ?
it be . you just kind of put a damper on thing when you say , the next person i see talk with food in their mouth will be put to death .
well , we could argue about who say what all night long , but to set thing back on course , i will propose a new topic of conversation .
great .
what be the best number ? by the way , there 's only one correct answer .
five million , three hundred eighteen thousand and eight ?
wrong . the best number be _ . you 're probably wonder why .
no .
uh-uh .
we 're good .
chuck norris wish . in binary , _ be a palindrome , one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards be one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one , exactly the same . all chuck norris backwards get you be sirron kcuhc .

oh , thanks .
mm-hmm .
that 's an atom .
so , you and zack again , huh ?
yeah , yeah , me and zack again .
okay , we should , we should go .
oh , and the science dude want to talk science with you . what do you want to talk about , rock , dinosaur , our friend the beaver ?
be the starfish wear boxer short ? because you might have be watch nickelodeon .
they might be smarter than some people .
oh , that 's easy enough . we 'd need a large tank of water , a hoop to jump through , and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treat you find tasty .

the archies be over here .
of course . we 're come a the justice league of america .

to that point , it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare best group costume if we shore up our weak link , which be clearly leonard a superman .
hey , i get new boot this year . guaranteed to add three inch .
that 's sad . let 's ask ourselves , be there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of krypton ?
i be think specifically of the gentleman over there move his lip a he enjoys the late exploit of betty and veronica .
he be the only person we know with actual muscle .
you ca n't replace me with zack .
why not ? penny do it .
yeah , she seem happier . why would n't we be ?

okay , i guess we just go without a wonder woman .
oh , great . no superman , no wonder woman ? all we 've get be a skinny flash , an indian aquaman , a nearsighted green lantern , and a teeny , tiny dark knight .

i 'm kermit . you 're scooter .
oh , man . scooter suck . he 's the aquaman of the muppet baby .

yes . and make her wear the black wig . good luck .
it 's leonard .

it 's not the wig .
then what be you ?
i do n't know . i only start see zack again so i would n't be alone on new year 's eve . how pathetic be that ?
not a pathetic a dress up like this and go to a comic book store on new year 's eve .
you make a cute green arrow .
like there 's a difference .
there 's a big difference . arrow . lantern .
whatever . look , if zack and i have just go to a regular club or a party , it would have be fine , but this , with the costume , and you .
what about me ?
nothing . let 's go to the party . how do i look ?
um , i guarantee you 'll be the prettiest girl there .
oh .
what 's the bad news ?
thank you ! thank you so much !
stop counting !
this be my moment , dag nab it !
i 'm not go to say another word until you people settle down . i 'm wait .
be you high ?
you 're be a bully .
check it out . those guy be break into that car .
what should we do ?
we 're the justice league of america . there 's only one thing we can do . turn around and slowly walk away .
look , i know our winter thermostat set be _ degree , but i 'm a little warm , so i 'm go to turn it down .
good lord , how you frustrate me , leonard hofstadter ! fine .
i wo n't say that all senior citizen who ca n't master technology should be publicly flog , but if we make an example of one or two , it might give the others incentive to try harder .
i have a great idea . you know how we 're always have to stop and solve differential equation , like when you 're do fourier analysis , or use the schrodinger equation ?
howard do n't . he 's only an engineer .
you know , leonard , that 's actually a valid idea . very good .
can you say that and not make it sound like i 'm a cat who learn how to use the toilet ?
a few extra buck would be nice . i could finally move out of my mother 's house .
where would you go ?
i always dream about building a little place of my own over the garage .
you know , if i make more money , i could take time off from work and give pretty girl submarine ride .
what 's that ? some weird sex thing ?
no . you take pretty girl underwater in your private submarine , and you show them fish . why do everything have to be dirty with you ?
i be think we could work on this at night , and then maybe in a couple of week , we 'll have ourselves an app to sell .
sound like we 're in business .
i think we should take a picture to capture this moment .
yeah .
oh !
be that the best _ cent i ever spent , or what ?
i checked the app store . no one be do handwriting-recognition differential equation solve .
oh , dear lord , shush .
what ?
who , me ?
sheldon , i do n't think penny care about handwriting-recognition base differential
the star at night be big and bright , deep in the heart of texas .
she 's not go to steal our idea .
what idea ?
we 're gon na write an application
the prairie sky be wide and high , deep in the heart
okay , stop , stop !
of texas .
whatever your secret be , i 'm sure it 's boring , so i 'm not interested .
it 's not boring at all . you see , in high order mathematics , there be certain set of equation that
bore .
satisfied ?
hardly . consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario . a young woman alone in the big city . her ridiculous dream of become an actress lie shatter about her .
hey , wait a minute .
well , hang on . let 's see where he 's go .
then it hit her . how be she go to survive ? i mean , she have no prospect , no marketable skill . and then one day , she meet a group of genius and their friend howard .
hang on . let 's see where he 's go .
she befriends them , and then lie in wait until they reveal a marketable idea , which she steal and sell to the high bidder .
that be ridiculous .
oh , be it ? well let 's see you come up with an explanation a to why this woman hang out with u all the time .
oh , great . you know what ? i 've already mooch dinner off you guy . i do n't need to listen to this .
there 's your answer , free food .
all right , i 've take the liberty of draft these workflow chart which outline our various duty and the path we will follow a we develop our ground-breaking new app .
hey , why be i in charge of phone support ? seem a bit racist .
oh . very clever . but still racist .
duly note , steve from wichita .
why be i list a your executive assistant ?
because the word secretary have fall into disrepute . fyi , my mother 's birthday be come up . i 'm go to need you to pick up a present .
okay , we need to stop for a minute .
leonard , please , we can talk during our break . we have one come up at midnight . we 'll need snack .
sheldon , you 're not in charge . it 's my idea . i 'm in charge .
oh , of course you be . look at the organizational chart . you 're clearly list a founder .
well , yes , and you 're list a chief executive officer , chief financial officer and chief operating officer .
you miss chief science officer , chairman of the board , and head of the secret santa committee .
okay . you need to get clear on this right now . i be in charge of this project .
ooh . leonard 's go all alpha nerd on sheldon 's as .
all right . all right , i 'm not go to argue with you . sheldon cooper be nothing if not a team player . dr hofstadter , you have the conn .
thank you . i thought we might start by talk about the user interface .
oh , dear lord , we 're doom .
good one , bos .
what ?
this diagram . i assume you be opening with a joke . it certainly buoyed up this employee 's esprit de corp .
it 's not a joke . it 's the real design .
in that case , may i offer _ little tweak to make it slightly less embarrass ?
sheldon , i think this will work . let 's just try it my way .
oh , i 'm , i 'm sorry . i assume that you want candid truth-telling from your employee , but i realize now , you want the mindless natter of complacent yes-man .
be you do ?
if you say so , bos .
so right now , this button-press event be just trigger a dummy procedure call
how about this for the app name ? the surprisingly helpful equation-linked differential optimize numerator .
so it spell sheldon ?
do it ? a happy accident .
we 're not do name now . howard ?
like i be say , right now it 's just a dummy procedure , but eventually , it will drop u into
no .
well , but hear me out . the atomic bomb be the manhattan project . window _ be originally project chicago . for our app , i would humbly suggest project nodlehs .
that 's just sheldon backwards .
we 're not waste time with name right now .
i see . be that decision open for discussion ?
no .
be the decision to not discus it open for discussion ?
no .
again , right now it 's just a dummy procedure , but eventually , it will drop u into
i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership .
oh sheldon , stop it .
when in the course of human event , it becomes necessary to dissolve the bond that tie three competent scientist together
that 's enough , sheldon .
all right , let 's get right to the vote . show of hand all those oppose to leonard and his reign of tyranny .
okay , that 's it , you 're fire .
really ? why ?
because you 're impossible to work with .
i see . and be that open for discussion ?
what be you do ?
but i fire you .
oh , i know . i 'm now an independent contractor .
no , you be now nothing . you have no connection to this project whatsoever .
but i make it well .
well , that speaks volume , do n't it ? all right , i suppose i 'll go put on my bus pant .
what the hell be bus pant ?
except you identify me , your best friend , a a gangrenous limb that need to be sever from the organism and toss away . the desperate act of a little man with a big napoleon complex .
you know what ? go put on your bus pant .
world 's great astrophysicist ?
do n't thank me . you earn it .
howard wolowitz . why not world 's great engineer ?
i understand . and your loyalty be admirable . but what if i be to up the ante ?
what be you talk about ?
monogrammed key chain with a built-in laser pointer . no ? how about can cosy emblazon with our university mascot ? go , beaver . i 'll be back .
hold on . that 's it !
eureka !
fine . let 's say it together .
no . the moment have pass .
greeting , gentleman . how go your little project ?
you mean , project lenwoloppali ?
we 're actually scan equation and get good result .
oh , well then , by all mean , carry on . i would n't want to impede your progress .
howard , do you solve the install time problem yet ?
what be you do ? !
play the theremin .
no . i mean , what be you do with a theremin ?
sheldon ! we 're work here !
that 's all right . i can barely hear you over my theremin . well , that be a little uncalled for .
so , your project be more important than mine ?
do n't beat around the bush , leonard . if you do n't want me here , just say the word , and i 'll leave .
could have beaten around the bush a little .
nobody know the trouble i 've see , nobody know my sorrow-ow-ow-ow .
what you do ? try to contact your home planet ?
i 'm practice my theremin .
oh .
nobody know the trouble i 've see . glory , hallelujah .
something get you down , there , sheldon ?
leonard kick me out of my own apartment . and his app team .
oh , honey , i 'm sorry .
he would n't drive me to work today . i have to wear my bus pant .
be that so ?
yes . and they 're still sticky .
aw .
probably go to have to throw them away .
hey , you do n't need leonard and his app . you can make one with me .
with you ?
seriously , i have a great idea for one .
be it well than your idea to move to los angeles and become a famous actress ?
that 's your app idea ?
i do n't say that . but no , i do n't .
why not ?
oh , penny , where do i begin ? the simple-mindedness of your idea be exceed only by it crass consumerism and banality .
and leonard do n't want to work with you ? imagine that .
i know , it 's baffling . nobody know the trouble i 've see .
sheldon , i 'm gon na make some cocoa . do you want some ?
do you make it with milk or water ?
milk .
real cocoa ?
that 's what it say on the packet .
no , sorry .
what do that mean ?
a disappoint drink for a disappoint day .
hey , look at this . _ people from the university have already sign up for our private beta .
what do you think we should sell it for ?
well , base on the fact that our potential market be about _ or _ guy , and you want a submarine , i 'd say about a million dollar a pop .
well , what if we put out a lite version for half a million ? you know , get the word of mouth go .
hi . i 'm sorry to bother you guy , but you 've get to come take your sheldon back .
what 's he do in your apartment ?
well , he be mop down in the lobby , so i invite him over , and now i regret it .
why do you regret , uh , never mind , stupid question .
we 're not play . this be real work .
we 're go to be hundred-aires .
okay . what if i get him to apologize and promise to behave ?
then i guess we would let him back on the app team , and while we 're do that , you could take an aerial tour of l.a on your fly pig .
okay . wait right here .
oh , yes . he say they be lose without you .
well , we sure saw that come .
you know what i 'm go to do ? i be go to sit here and just let them stew .
no , no , no . you know , they have suffer enough . everybody 's suffer enough . the thing be , you 're go to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this .
how ?
say you 're sorry .
oh , no . mr mary cooper do n't raise her no liar .
okay . um , how about this ? you know how you 're always try to learn about sarcasm ?
no ?
i be be sarcastic .
oh . good for you . so all you have to do here be say you 're sorry to leonard , but say it sarcastically .
of course . he will hear it a an attempt to mend fence , a oppose to the wither condemnation you and i will know it to be .
yeah . yeah , that be my plan . all right . come on . let 's go .
oh , by the way , thank you for the delicious cocoa .
oh , you 're welcome .
boy , i 'm get good at this .
before you begin , let me say again how deeply sorry i be for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership .
thank you . so a you can see , not only can you store your favourite equation , but you can forward them to your friend or post them on facebook right from the app .
well , i must say , i be impressed .
thanks .
you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work .
we have .
a a result , you have take the most important step on the road to success , learn what not to do . now , let 's start fresh . howard , we 're go to need some tea .

look , you say it yourself , we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy .

hey . so you guy ready to order ?
oh , gee , amy , i 'm sorry , i 'm actually pretty busy this weekend .
probably serve food that be order today .
the what ?
it 's an annual science conference . we 've all be invite to speak .

i 'm your best friend ?

i 'd like to kick your little brown as .
what do i do ?

i 'd like to weigh in here . no .
all right , why do n't we open it up to q & a from the audience ?
no !
red leader to red five . red leader to red five . anybody up for a little game ? i spy with my little eye , a nonferrous metal .
must be out of range .
leonard , can i ask you a question ?
sure .
be you bother by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what be probably the most beautiful man i 've ever see in my life ?
no . why do you ask ?
because we 're go _ mile per hour .
all right , if no one 's go to guess , i be spy the aluminium rim on the police car we pass a few mile back .
look . listen to this one . do einstein 's theory explain why time fly when you 're have fun , but when you 're listen to dr cooper , it fall out of the sky , dead ?
ooh , somebody take picture and uploaded them to their flickr account .
wow . how do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time ?
apparently , if you 're sheldon , all you need to do be turn your back .
hey , leonard , be your wi-fi down ? i ca n't get on .
oh , sheldon change the password . it 's now penny be a freeloader . no space .
thanks . what be you guy do ?
sheldon give a lecture at the university tonight . we 're reading the review .
oh . how 'd he do ?
well , picture the hindenburg meet chernobyl meet three mile island meet tron _ .
that bad , huh ?
read this woman 's tweet .
listen to dr cooper have make me want to start cut myself again
yeah .
good even , leonard , howard , raj , freeloader .
so , how 'd the lecture go ?
in a word , triumphant .
really ? triumphant ?
oh , yes , you should have see those young people . thirsty for knowledge , drinking in my wisdom . i may have change a few life today .
oh , please let me tell him .
i do n't know , i kind of promise howard .
tell me what ?
actually , we should all share the moment . raj , if you would .
oh , tweet about my lecture . hmm . that 's rather unfair . that 's downright cruel . plus , insect have six leg . yeah , i 'm not familiar with the acronym kmn .
well , i suppose everyone 's entitle to their own opinion . i think i 'll turn in . i do n't want to teach those poopy head , anyway .
fyi , i think that 's what darth vader say just before he start building the death star .
sheldon still mop ?
yeah , it 's weird . even though he do n't want to give the lecture in the first place , be reject by those student really hit him hard .
mmm , i know the feel . it 's like accidentally walk into a gay bar and then have no one hit on you . it-it happen to a friend of mine .
yeah , leonard and i be fine , but i think raj need to meet a girl really soon .
thank you , but cute be for bunny . i want to be something with sex appeal , like , like a labradoodle .
we might be start to zero in on your problem .
you really think so ?
well , thanks , bernadette . and just for the record , labradoodles be hypo-allergenic , which be a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander .
so , what do you think ?
it 's a charm illusion , but it do not cheer me up .
not even when i do this ?
no .
well , that be the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy .
if this humiliate experience be really trouble you , there be thing we could do about it .
for instance ?
well , the first thing that come to mind be isolate the part of your brain where the memory be store and destroy it with a laser .
hmm , no . one slip of the hand , and suddenly i 'm sit in the engineering department , building doodad with wolowitz .
all right . have you consider improve your socialization skill , thus allow you to communicate more effectively with other people ?
fair enough , but in it essence , teach be a performance art . in the classroom paradigm , the teacher have the responsibility to communicate , a well a entertain and engage .
i sense that you 're try to slow-walk me to an epiphany . would you mind very much jumping to it ?
act lesson . interest . it might help if i could act a though i care about my student and whether or not they learn .
penny . penny . penny .
what ?
you 're an actress , correct ?
i 'm not an actress . i 'm an actress .
all right . you 're an actress . i need you to teach me .
you want an act lesson ?
perhaps two . i 'd like to master the craft .
okay , where be this come from ?
it have be suggest to me that act technique could improve my lecture , at which , if certain tweet and blog be to be believe , i suck the big one .
yeah , i saw those . they be funny . i print a few out and put 'em on my fridge .
so , when could we start ?
i suppose that 's one way to look at it .
i think it 's the only way to look at it .
be you go to help me or not ?
oh , i 'm sorry , i thought make the transition from actor to act teacher be the signal that one 's career have reach the end of the road .
forget it .
i 'll pay you _ dollar .

how shall we begin ?
well , i thought we 'd start with some basic movement exercise . you know , get our body warm up a little .
all right .
so i just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space . you know , just do whatever feel natural . sheldon ?
you say to do whatever feel natural . this feel natural . certainly more natural than what you 're do .
come on , you get to work with me . we need to get connect with our body .
all right , let 's just say we 've warm up .
you 're the teacher .
okay . one of the thing that might help you in connect with your student be be a little more spontaneous . so why do n't we try some improvisation ?
why not ? it seem like you 're improvise your entire curriculum .
this be all about listen and respond .
gotcha .
all right .
all right .
action .
okay , it 's not a movie . it 's improv . so no one call action .
hey , you taught me something . who would have thought it ?

oh , and we 're go to use prop ?
you bet . i have dream , you know . i be gon na be famous . show everybody back home i could be someone . now look at me . want some ?

yes . i do n't care for it .
okay , cat on a hot tin roof be an american classic .
so be the mcrib sandwich . i do n't care for that , either .

i 'm glad you ask . i take the liberty of adapt a star trek fan fiction novella i write when i be ten into a one-act play .
and you think it 's well than tennessee williams ?
why do n't we leave that for future generation to decide ?
where no sheldon have go before .
it 's the story of a young boy who be transport from the ignorant backwoods of east texas to the 23rd century , where his genius be not only appreciate , but celebrate .
kmn .
now , in this pivotal scene , sheldon 's mother , played by you , argues with an emissary of the united federation of planet , mr spock , the role i will bring to life .
okay , that 's fine , but let 's try and get you out of your comfort zone .
why would we want to do that ? it 's call the comfort zone for a reason .
okay , the whole point of this be to loosen you up a little , so i 'm think you 'll play the role of your mother , and i will bring life to mr spock .
i 'm sorry . you 'll be spock ?
it 's only logical .
very well . i 'll set the scene .
all right .
hoo !
now just read your mother 's line .
glory be to heaven , some sort of creature just manifest out of thin air . george , put down that pepsi can full of bourbon that ai n't foolin ' no one , and get your shotgun !

dance number aside , i 'm so not gay .
here 's what i wonder about zombie . what happens if they ca n't get any human flesh to eat ? they ca n't starve to death , they 're already dead .
well-groomed vampire meet in pair and shave each other . case close .
yeah , okay , so , zombie .
you 're think of _ day later . _ day be where sandra bullock go to rehab and put the audience into an undead state
oh , dr siebert , twelve o'clock .
why 's the president of the university slum in the cafeteria ?
that depends , how much longer do you plan on fondle my shoulder ?
it 's not a touch phobia , it 's a germ phobia . if you 'd like to go put on a pair of latex glove , i 'll let you check me for a hernia .
sound great !
i 'm in !
hold on . just because the nice man be offering you candy , do n't mean you should jump into his windowless van . what 's the occasion ?

excuse me , my girlfriend do n't pick out my clothes . my mother do .
oh . we should get go .
sheldon be not go .
really ? what do we tell siebert ?
tell him dr cooper feel that the best use of his time be to employ his rare and precious mental faculty to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of god .
sheldon , it 's saturday night , you 'll be do laundry .
do n't tell him that , tell him the mask thing .
hey , put your tie back in your pant .
thanks .
nice place . reminds me of my parent ' house back in new delhi .
you 're kid .
no . we be very wealthy . but the only difference be , we have more servant .
more than this ?
more than we can use . you see , in india , we do n't make the mistake of let our poor people have dream .
he 's tear the mask off nature to look at the face of god .
i 'm an engineer . most engineer do n't bother with a phd . but you may be interested to know i design the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for nasa .
do him first .
uh b d uh uh
it 's koothrappali . i have to tinkle .
and so , instead of bow to pressure , and go to that pointless soiree , i stayed right here and do a load of white .
unlikely . but make your case . keep in mind that your critical attitude be ruin our saturday night together , and i 'm not above minimize your window .
i 'm not finish . all scientist have to fund-raise , sheldon . how do you think i paid for my lab ? i go to saudi arabia and met with a prince who have an interest in neurobiology .
your lab be fund by some middle-eastern dilettante ?
technically , faisal be my fiance . but i do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter .
well , that explains those puzzle camel race photo on your facebook page .
and consider this , without you to make the case for the physic department , the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh .
be you try to scare me ? ‘ cause you 're succeed .
well , then prepare to be terrify . if your friend be unconvincing , this year 's donation might go to , say , the geology department .
or bad , it could go to the liberal art .
no !
million of dollar be shower on poet , literary theorist and student of gender study .
oh , the humanity !
on the bright side , i do n't think president siebert will be make u go to any more fund-raisers .
it be so much easy at my bar mitzvah . the old people just come up to you , pinch your cheek and hand you a saving bond .
oh , do n't be such gloomy gu . look at the size of these shrimp ! at what point do we start call them lobster ?
face it , raj , we crashed and burn tonight .
you 're kid . that be good for you ? ‘ cause i be sweat through my t-shirt .
why ?
well , wherever we 're go , she 's send a car to pick me up .
what ?
my stature intimidates her , so she 's use you to get to me . crafty old gal .
excuse me , but you be not the only distinguish scientist in this apartment . i 've be publish in peer-reviewed journal , i receive a dissertation of the year award for experimental particle physic .
no , that ca n't be it . and since you seem to have forgotten , the reason we live together be we 're best friend . and i get your back , jack .
that be a great meal .
you kind of remind me of her . she enjoys make people uncomfortable , too .
no kid .
yeah , um , so , hey , speak of money , how be you feel about help the physic department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve ?
oh , good , good .
terrific . great . what level be that ? okay , now you do n't remind me of my mom .
i 'm sorry , so , eventually , zombie be go to attack the rehab facility where sandra bullock be ?
yes , sheldon . keep watch .
you know , it 's a shame , all that work she 's do to get sober , only to be torn apart and eat alive .

well , n-no , hold on a second , i 'm not go to sleep with her .
but we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump .
well , come now , leonard , this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science !
i repeat , not gon na happen .

it be a compliment . i believe in give credit where credit be due .
okay , fine . i 'll tell him . leonard , mr latham 's car be here for you .
i wo n't be too late . i 'm just gon na make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night .

maybe this will overcome your reluctance . i go on the internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old mr latham to get your libido hum . check out those saddle shoe . rar !
be you insane ? i 'm not go to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment .
oh , come on ! why not ?

fine . in the parlance of the urban music scene , what 's the _ ?
bernadette be think about break up with howard .
i believe our nation 's tuna can be safe . excuse me . dr greene , question ?
you 've dedicate your life 's work to educate the general populace about complex scientific idea .

nice shot .

really ? i do n't see you draw one from your quiver .
i 'm not go to do that , sheldon .
she be attempt to engage me in gossip .
you do n't say ?
yes . i think prolong exposure to penny have turn her into a bit of a gabby gertie .
so , what 's the gossip ?
oh , please , i be just point it out . i have no desire to engage in the activity .
fine , do n't tell me .
all right , get this . bernadette be think about break up with howard .
oh . that 's too bad . i wonder what happen .
priya , can i come in ?
oh , god .
it 's okay . you do n't know . i 'll take care of it .
sheldon do n't allow floss that close to the mirror .
it 's a splatter thing . there 's a little piece of tape on the floor you 're suppose to stand behind .
i know . just do it . there 's a big inspection come up , and i do n't want to lose my tv privilege .
mm , i do n't know . i get a lawyer , he get a lawyer , it 's just easy to stand behind the tape .
yeah ! dodger be baseball , right ?
mm , it 's complicate , but a i remember it , the essential be , get chosen last , get hit by the ball , cry , go home .
well , it might not be a great idea to invite those two .
do n't tell anybody i told you , but i heard she might be break up with him .
really ? who ?
what ? you 're kid !
wow , that 's hard to believe .
oh , that one do n't apply to you . you sit .
hey !
hey ! how 's it go ?
not too bad . do you hear about howard and bernadette ?
‘ course i heard about it . how do you hear about it ?
i heard about it from sheldon . he get it from amy .
oh , damn it . i told amy that in the strictest confidence . boy , some people be such blabbermouth . well , whatever , i 'm sure bernadette can do well .
do you think a sexually ambivalent indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issue be well than a hundred-pound jewish guy who life with his mom ?
you be kid . raj like bernadette ?
i do n't say raj . who say raj ?
okay , give . how do you know ? do he tell you ?
no .
well , then who ?
i ca n't say .
priya told you . what a little gossip . you know , not an attractive quality in a woman , leonard . not judging , just my opinion .
well , the point be , if this get out , it would destroy howard and raj 's friendship .
you do n't have to worry . unlike amy and priya , i know how to keep a secret .
you 're the one who told amy in the first place .
in confidence !
hello , mummy . hello , daddy . how be you ?
i be make her comfortable . besides , she 's not sleep here half the time anyway .
it , it do n't matter . howard have a girlfriend .
what do that mean ?
be something go on with him and bernadette ?
do n't worry . everything i have , i share with her . include my friend leon
fair enough . now , what 's up with clarinet ? bernadette !
i 've be think about dr greene 's effort to make science palatable for the mass .
hmm ? oh , i 'm sorry . i be somewhere else .
lucky bastard .
so what 's up ?
it 's a bernadette thing .
oh , no . i hope everything 's okay .
whatever it be , we 're here for you . you can tell u anything .
yeah . good or devastate .
i 'm gon na ask her to marry me .
marry you ?
what ?
yeah . i just need to figure out the right time to pop the question .
oh , i 'd wait .
no rush , no rush .
i know . it 'll be awful .
why be you smile ?
yeah , raj , why ?
uh , a smile mean something different in my country . you know , tear of joy , smile of sadness . india 's a goofy place .
oh , i 'm back to train . woo-woo .
do i tell you our lab get a grant to study addiction ?
no .
fascinate work . i recently train a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarette .
have you learn anything ?
if you do n't mind , i 'd like to stop listen to you and start talk .
howard have announce his intention to propose marriage to bernadette .
i do n't understand . the original piece of gossip indicate an impend breakup .
i know . the group consensus be that his proposal will be met with an humiliate , soul-crushing rejection . everyone be set a-twitter . although oddly , no one tweet .
it 's not surprising that the story have capture the attention of our little circle of friend . be you familiar with meme theory ?
i 'm familiar with everything , but go on .
meme theory suggests that item of gossip be like living thing that seek to reproduce use human a their host .
i 'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology . at johnson elementary school , the phrase shelly cooper 's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire .
i should think so . that 's gold .
your meme hypothesis do intrigue me . how might we examine this more closely ?
do you have any ethical qualm regard human experimentation ?
it 's one of the few form of interaction with people that i do n't find repellent .
we need to fabricate a tantalize piece of gossip .
then we 'll track it progress through our social group and interpret the result through the compete academic prism of memetic theory , algebraic gossip and epidemiology .
look at you , get me to engage in the social science . you 're a vixen , amy farrah fowler .
oh , hey , amy . what 's up ?
me , too . good time .
hey , _ want to order appetizer .
this be nice .
what the hell be you do ? howard be your best friend , and that be his girlfriend . you should be ashamed of yourself .
i be when i come in , but it 's amaze what liquor do to guilt . besides what you might not know be , bernadette be planning on break up with howard .
well , i know that . how do you know that ?
my sister told me .
oh , that gossipy bitch ! no offense .
none take . you should hear how she talk about you .
all right , try think about this . sheldon and amy have sex .
shut your as !
yeah , it 's true . amy told me .
how do that even happen ? do they know that 's what they be do when they be do it ?
wow . i ca n't believe old smelly pooper finally get laid .
hey .
hey .
hope you 're hungry .
interest . a friendly sentiment in this country , cruel taunt in the sudan . it 's a lesson in context .
will amy be join u for dinner ?
yes , i believe so .
good , good . everything okay between you two ?
yes . why do you ask ?
no reason . i be just talk to raj , and he mention what a lovely glow she have these day .
do he mean a if she 'd be out in the sun , tend an herb garden without wear a hat or sunblock ?
no . that 's not what he meant .
well , we may never know . a my mother would say , the asian be an inscrutable folk . now , if you 'll excuse me , i have work to do .
yeah , you do . you dog , you .
do you get that ?
every word . our false gossip meme appear to have reach node lambda .
this be move faster than we thought .
agree . it appear the rate of gossip transmission be proportional to the number of node square .
i must say , amy , pretend to have intercourse with you be give me a great deal of satisfaction .
slow down , sheldon . i 'm not quite there yet .
pas the soy sauce .
bernadette just ask about my sexual encounter with you . the meme have reach full penetration .
pun intend ?
this be remarkable . take less than _ hour .
i should let you know that she ask for detail about our dalliance .
interest . so it go beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow , a it be .
pun intend ?
i 'm sorry . what pun ?
not important . i described your lovemaking a aloof , but effective .
i wish you have n't do that . that 's go to make me a chick magnet , and i 'm so busy a it be .
hey , everybody , i get something i want to ask bernadette , and i ca n't think of a well time than when i 'm with all my friend .
oh , hold on , howard . there 's lot of well time .
leonard , please . the man be talk . let him get it out , and let the chip fall where they may .
thank you . bernadette maryann rostenkowski
i know thing have n't be perfect with u , and we 've have our problem , but i just have to tell you , from the moment i
yes , what ?
you will ?
you will ?
oh , i love you so much .
congratulation !
i wonder what change her mind .
perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renew her faith in love .
a good an explanation a any .
that 's great .

yes , not important . just stop by to let you know i 'm get orthotics . also , i 'm carry sheldon 's baby . mum 's the word .
you 're pregnant ?

what kind of emergency ?
mathematical . 32-ounce banana smoothie , 16-ounce bladder .
you might not want to do that .
i assure you i do .
sheldon , i 'm not alone in here .
what ?
accord to the roommate agreement , paragraph nine , subsection b , the right to bathroom privacy be suspend in the event of force majeure . and believe me , i be experience a very majeure force .
come on , you ca n't wait two minute ?
penny ? penny ? penny ?
what ?
oh . cool . i 've get a lawyer . and i 've see her naked .
um , it 's fairly technical .
do so , do so .
oh , that 's ridiculous . a bathroom emergency be self-explanatory .
irrelevant . leonard do n't trim his nose hair . he think because he 's short nobody can see up there .
school !
this be n't over .
no offence , but shower sex with you be now the second best thing that 's happen today .
mmm , greek food on pizza night ? this be the most delightfully cruel thing we 've do to sheldon since we left that fake message from stephen hawk on his voice mail .
i wish to discus your theory of black hole . meet me at the randy 's donut by the airport at _ a.m .
what be that you 're eat ? tonight be pizza night .
i 'd like to refer that to my attorney .
yes , and when franconi 's go out of business , we switch to graziano 's .
that 's interest . can you just switch restaurant like that , priya ?
this be greek food ? leonard , you hate greek food .
not a much a you .

really , amy ? tobacco and alcohol ? need i remind you not a lot of scientific discovery be make by people have a good time ?
i felt sorry for him . priya 's give him a hard time .
pantsuit suck .
and that open her up to justifiable ridicule for wear them . good one , bernadette . see ? ker-razy .
you smell like baby powder .
it 's talc . but a that 's a primary ingredient of baby powder , i understand your confusion .
oh , i 'm not confuse at all . you 're like a sexy toddler .
i do n't know how to process that .
that 's too many s 's for kiss .
sheldon , have you ever kiss a girl ?
yeah , you 're a scientist , where be the curiosity ?
i 'm available for experimentation .
thank you . not necessary . we know everything there be to know about kiss . it require _ facial muscle and _ postural muscle .
oh , blah , blah , blah . give me some sugar , bestie .
i 'm certainly glad no one say they be curious about aztec human sacrifice .
hey , i know , let 's take sheldon dance .
no , thank you , but for the record , i 'm an excellent dancer . proficient in the rumba , waltz and cha-cha .
really ?
i do n't see why that 's surprising . i excel at so many thing . you 've have my sourdough bread .
against my will . in the south , pre-adolescent child be force through a process call cotillion , which indoctrinates them with all the social grace and dance skill need to function in 18th century vienna .

be he deliberately blowing smoke at me ?
yeah . he 's kind of an as .
thank you . may i share something with you that 's trouble me ?
of course . what 's rattle around that big bulbous brain of yours ?
priya have essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard , make life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me .
and you want me to kill her ? do .
no , of course not .
i train ricky how to smoke . i can train him to shoot a poison dart . no jury would convict u 'cause people love monkey .
i understand the alcohol have stir up whatever it be that make girl go wild , but i really need to talk to smart amy now .
excuse me . have you consider that your intelligence might be the very thing cause your dilemma ?
no .

be you suggest i play dirty ?
yes , dirty . dirty , dirty , dirty . which brings me to our next order of business .
fascinate .
i hope you do n't take what i 'm about to do a a comment on what we just do .

incorrect . obviously , the answer be cheese danish .
what ?
be he always like this when he loses ?
oh , yes . you should 've be here for the great jenga tantrum of _ .
you bumped the table and you know it .
perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suit to his ability . we 'll close our eye and count to ten while you hide .
i 'm go to my room .
very good , leonard . but next time , do n't tell u where you 're hiding .
do you guy see the paper in the american physic journal on supersolids ? it 's pretty interest . this guy 's work from a hypothesis where
spoiler alert ! spoiler alert .
what ?
do n't ruin it for me , man . i print out a pdf to read on the potty .

ah , ah .
okay . toilet 's sound pretty good now , huh ?
shamy ?
a juvenile amalgamation of our name . sheldon and amy , shamy .
oh . i do n't like that . do n't do that .
all righty . what 's new ?
well , just recently , i learn that you refer to u a shamy , and i do n't like that .
i get it . but what i be go for be , you know , how 's your life ?
like everybody else 's . subject to entropy , decay and eventual death . thank you for ask . why be she not take our order ?
i should 've warn you , one have to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here .
it 's how they lure you in . i believe it 's call bait and switch .
okay , i 'm just gon na walk away , 'cause i do n't want to be here .
so , this be nice . first time we 've all gotten together to eat .
you 're right , he 's a festival of humdrum chitchat .
okay , that 's all i get . howard , you 're up .
um , tell u about your work , amy .
i doubt you 'd understand . sheldon tell me you only have a master 's degree .
raj , do you have any question for amy ?
i 'm curious a to why we 're not eat alone .
get it .
although , for the record , on one occasion , she lick her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth . it 's an action we both regret to this day .
uh-huh . anyway , i 'm not sure she 's the best fit for our little , how should we call it , rebel alliance .
oh , i never identify with the rebel alliance . despite their tendency to build death star , i 've always be more of an empire man .
yeah , not my point .
i know what your point be . you 're intimidate by amy 's intellect . to that i say , buck up .
okay , let me just get right to it . amy be judgmental , sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious .
so ?
be you suggest i terminate my relationship with amy ?
no , no , of course not . just have your relationship someplace else .
really ? silence ?
philadelphia .
really ? i thought they be out west someplace .
think about it , raj . where do the movie rocky take place ?
philadelphia . okay , now i get it .
i 'm very comfortable here . penny , dear , why do n't you shoot another silver bullet my way ?
get one yourself .
ooh , somebody 's be take bitchy pill .
god , he 's an as when he drink .
oh , he 's an as when he do n't . you just do n't hear it .
i think we need to start entertain the possibility that the shamy could go on for year .
well , if that 's the case , penny will have to get satellite tv and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place .
i thought you be go to talk to sheldon .
i do .
well , what 'd he say ?
well , he point out that he kinda , sorta have to put up with you .
kinda , sorta have to ?
i do n't agree with him .
well , you defend me , right ?
i try , but he make a fairly well-reasoned argument .
gim me .
no .
trust me .
no !
i do this for my mom all the time . see ? with the grain .
wow , that be well .
oh , god , never again .
the highlight of the even be when you show u your bollywood break dance skill .
that 's very offensive .
yeah , we all thought so .
oh , no .
what ?
john and yoko .
more like yoko and yoko .
greeting .
hey .
i brought amy here to show her some of the work i 'm do .
it 's very impressive , for theoretical work .
do i detect a hint of condescension ?
oooh !
be you suggest the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarke-maxwell or dirac ?
i 'm state it outright . babinski eats dirac for breakfast and defecates clarke-maxwell .
you take that back .
excuse me , but a grand unified theory , insofar a it explains everything , will ipso facto explain neurobiology .
yes , but if i 'm successful , i will be able to map and reproduce your thought process in derive a grand unified theory , and therefore , subsume your conclusion under my paradigm .
that 's the rankest psychologism , and be conclusively reveal a hogwash by gottlob frege in the 1890s !
we appear to have reach an impasse .
i agree . i move our relationship terminate immediately .
second .
there be no objection
the motion carry . good day , amy farrah fowler .
good day , sheldon cooper .
woman , huh ? ca n't live with them , ca n't successfully refute their hypothesis .
amen to that .
hey , sheldon .
hello .
i hear you broke up with amy .
a breakup would imply she be my girlfriend . she be a girl who be my friend who be now a girl who be not my friend .
wow . that 's like the bad country song ever . so , how be you do ?
regard what ?
amy .
i do n't follow .

i get ta tell you guy , i 'm a little worried about sheldon .
we 're all a little worried about sheldon .
no , i mean since the shamy hit a reef .
oh , i thought you be just make a generalization , you know , i 'm worried about sheldon someday set off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime jell-o .
what do hit a reef mean ?
uh , go splitsville .
pardon ?
turn to boom-boom .
ah .
i think sheldon really miss amy .
you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks .

a group of cat be a clowder . or a glare .
okay , yeah , fine .
it 's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one .
terrific . my-my point be you need to face up to what you 're feel with this breakup .
it be n't a breakup . a breakup would imply that amy be my girlfriend .
she do n't dump me . it be mutual !
i be there . she dumped you .
okay , fine . live with cat . be like my aunt nancy . she have dozen of them . and do you know what happen after she die ? they ate her .
he 's in his bedroom .
no , she 's real .
no , no , it 's not like that . it 's , uh , i do n't know what it 's like . but there be something i should prepare you for .
hold on to that thought .
come in .
surprise .
mom , what an unexpected pleasure .
i 'd like you to meet oppenheimer , frisch , panofsky , feynman , weisskopf
what be you do here ?
oh , that 's preposterous . i 'm not pin over anyone .
i do not agree . cat make wonderful companion . they do n't argue or question my intellectual authority , and this little guy here , i think you 'll find to be quite zazzy .

yes , ma'am .
well , whether you see it or not be irrelevant . i ca n't see subatomic particle , but nevertheless , they 're there .
excellent point .
a physic point .
touche .
i 'll agree to that only if you 'll stipulate that _ % of our difficulty be cause by you .
i 'll go a high a _ .
sixty-five .
do . you understand that move forward , we deal with the fact that my mother do not approve of you ?
i do . i find be cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillate .

and with that mental picture , i think we 're do for the even .

yeah , i guess that .
it be the kind of thing that make it kind of hard to face her now .
all right , fine . so you want to get back together with her , but you 're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it be you do .
in a nutshell .
okay . well , how about this ? kidnap bernadette from the opera wear a creepy mask so she do n't know it 's you .
now , you see , i do n't know if you 're kid or not .
you 're be unreasonable . why ca n't i have a desk ?

why ca n't he have a desk , sheldon ?
yes .
okay , what if he buy his own desk ?
yeah , what if i buy my own desk ?

they do some of their best work at night .
ah , it 's okay .

bernadette . she be so mad at me , she would n't even listen to my side of the story .
well , what be your side ?
well , for all we know , glissinda the troll be n't even a real woman . i mean , she could 've be a 50-year-old truck driver in new jersey .
really ? and that do n't make her feel well ?
will you talk to her , see if there 's any chance at all we could get back together ?
oh , gee , howard , i really do n't want to get in the middle of this .
you know , i 've always blame myself for him leave . i always thought it be because i be n't the son he want .
yeah , i say i 'd think about it .
i be n't athletic , yeah , i be kind of sickly .
okay , fine . look , look , i 'm call her now ! see ?
thank you .
so anyway , howard ask penny to talk to bernadette , and she do , and bernadette agree to meet him for a cup of coffee .
one question .

why on earth be you tell me all this ?
i do n't know . sometimes your movement be so lifelike , i forget you 're not a real boy .
you say i could buy a desk .
this be n't a desk . this be a brobdingnagian monstrosity .
be that the american idiom for giant , big-ass desk ?

oh . i 'm sorry .
well , you know how it be with guy . i mean , we have need and
well , not real girl .
you know , you look thirsty . i brought you some iced tea .

short joke ? really ? you 're , like , a quarter of an inch taller than me .
yeah , and do n't you forget it .
i have a good time .

no , you do n't . it 's me . the lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pant .
oh , god , what 's that smell ? . oh-ho-hoo !
yes ?
what be you do in there ?
i 'm make hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas . just a little experiment in pest control .
it 's not gon na work , dude , i grow up in india , an entire subcontinent where cow walk in the street , and nobody have ever have a solid bowel movement .
well , we 'll just see how long you can hold out .
well , we 'll just see how your noxious gas fare against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candle .
do n't you say you 're make hydrogen sulphide gas ?
yes .
be n't that flammable ?
all i 'm say be , if they take all the money they spent try to make a decent hulk movie , they could probably just make an actual hulk .
that be apt and amuse . i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler . she 'll appreciate the witticism .
thank you .
so what 's go on with you two ?
well , the status be a it always be . she 's a girl . she 's a friend . she be not my , please forgive me for do this , girlfriend .
right , right . so you 're still just texting and email ? you do n't feel any need to hang out with her , you know , be in the same room ?
leonard , you be my best friend . i 've know you for seven year , and i can barely tolerate sit on the couch with you . imagine my attitude regard prolong physical proximity to amy farrah fowler .
get it .
i sense judgment on your part .
no , no . maybe a little .
may i suggest that your criticism be base on jealousy .
i have a function and satisfy relationship with a female . you have none .
hu-u-urgh ! leonard not jealous .
you know , it just occur to me , if there be an infinite number of parallel universe , in one of them , there 's probably a sheldon who do n't believe parallel universe exist .
probably . what 's your point ?
no point . it 's just one of the thing that make one of the me chuckle . what make you chuckle , leonard ?
hmm , recently ? not much .
be it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman , and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity ?
um , shut up .
it be if you like bridge . do you like bridge , leonard ?
sheldon , i 'm just not date someone right now . i do n't need to go to a senior centre .
meemaw resist at first , but now she love it .
fine . if i do n't meet someone soon , you can put me in a home .
it 's not a home . it 's a senior centre . we 'd never put meemaw in a home !
hey , guy .
hey .
hey .
all right , i 'll bow to social pressure . hey !
excuse me . that 's my girlfriend , bernadette . i assign her her own ringtone , bernadette by the four top . hello , bernadette .
you realize he 's just rub our nose in the fact that he have a girlfriend , and we do n't .
you mean , you do n't .
you have a girlfriend ? how could you have a girlfriend ? you ca n't even speak to woman .
two word , deaf chick . it do n't matter if i ca n't talk , because she ca n't hear me .
what ?
that 's what she say .
great . you have a girlfriend , howard 's get a girlfriend , sheldon 's get a girl
no , no , no , no !
thank you .
what about you , stuart ? you have a girlfriend yet ?
oh . well , good for you .
why do n't you just break up with her ?
why not ?
because i do n't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriend . i 'm perfectly capable of find a girl on my own .
oh , leonard , you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walk into a woman 's correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convict to go free .
you 're say i could n't get laid in a woman 's prison with a handful of pardon .
be you go to let me tell the story or not ?
leonard ? be you sleep ?
no .
be you ill ?
no .
be you still depressed because you 're alone , and no one love you ?
i do n't know . maybe .
i want you to know that i 'm genuinely concerned about your well-being .
thank you .
you 're welcome . but it 's still no reason to have your foot in my spot .
what the hell ? how long have she be here ?
that be two hour ago .
a per your suggestion , we 're hang out . quite frankly , i do n't see what all the hoopla 's about . go on , amy .
from a neurobiological standpoint , leonard , you may be alone because your psychological state be cause an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation .
do you know that , leonard ?
no .
i do .
i understand that some people find mate in social gathering place such a bar or tavern . have you try a bar or tavern ?
no , i 'm not gon na try to pick up a woman in a bar .
that 's not true of all bar . juice bar , for example .
oh ! good point , amy . yeah , building on your premise , leonard could frequent sushi bar , salad bar , oyster bar , the apple genius bar , what be you do ?
keep go . i 'm listen .
that be rude .
cornucopia . what a mellifluous word .
agree . and we 'll use mellifluous tomorrow .
well , i have to void my bladder . it be nice spending this time with you .
wait . i have a request .
yes ?
i 'd like you to meet my mother .
i see . can i get back to you on that ?
certainly . good night .
amy farrah fowler have ask me to meet her mother .
yeah . so ?
what do that mean ?
uh-huh .
you ca n't say that anymore .
wait . what ?
look , she obviously want to take your relationship to the next level .
i do n't want the next level . i like this level . fix it for me !
simple ! you want a girlfriend , amy want to be someone 's girlfriend . take her off my hand . i give you my blessing .
that be insane .
you 're right . it would never work . amy find you tedious .
okay , good luck .
well , have you consider tell her how you feel ?
leonard , i 'm a physicist , not a hippie .
all right , well , let me see if i can explain your situation use physic . what would you be if you be attach to another object by an inclined plane wrap helically around an axis ?
screw .
why ca n't you get it ?
oh , hey . i hope you do n't hear that .
the volcano thing ? no .
no , it 's just something i threw on .
i know all your shirt . that 's not one of them . you be pretend to work at the genius bar to pick up woman , be n't you ?
yeah . turn out , they guard the ipod , but they do n't guard the shirt .
so , how 'd it go ?
i want to invoke the girlfriend pact , howard .
you that desperate ?
no , i just , i want what you have . you know , i want a woman in my life .
to be clear , i meant like bernadette , not your mother .
well , i 'm off to meet bernadette 's friend . how do i look ?
a if one of the plant from invasion of the body snatcher duplicate you in every way , only with an absurd amount of hair gel .
what be you work on ?
i 'm remove my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler ca n't find me and compel me to meet her mother .
ah , you 're go off the grid .
exactly .
the old unabomber approach . kudos .
thank you . i 've also sent amy a relationship termination notice and change my cell phone number and e-mail address .
what if she just come over ?
she 'll get lose . we no longer live at _ los roble . we now live at _ los roble .
you change the address on the building ? what about mail ?
oh , no worry , i explain my predicament to our letter carrier . he be sympathetic . his exact word be , get your back , jack . bitch be crazy .
who be it ?
amy farrah fowler .
darn ! she found me !
she 's be here before .
the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan . now , get my back , jack .
what do you want to do ?
tell her i 'm not here .
okay , where be you ?
i do n't know . you 'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence , keep in mind that the key to a good lie lie in the detail .
hi , amy . sheldon 's not here .
all right .
way to go on the detail .
thanks again for do this , bernadette .
hi .
uh
yeah . so , bernadette tell me she know you from self-defence class ?
wow . would n't think there 'd be that many .
whoa !
should be , it 's thirty dollar a pound .
yep , it be .
whoa !
i think she like you .
ez aquarii b , ez aquarii c , excuse me , madam .
sheldon ?
i believe a misunderstand may have occur when i ask you to meet my mother .
no misunderstand . i 've learn what that request actually mean , and i do n't want to be join to another object by an inclined plane wrap helically around an axis .
in what way be you screw ? all i want to do be present you a my boyfriend to my mother so she 'll be satisfied that i 'm in a relationship .
so we 'd be perpetrate a ruse ?
precisely .
do n't be absurd . i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that add no value to human relationship .
amy farrah fowler , that 's the most pragmatic thing anyone have ever say to me .
i trust this clarification allows u to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status .
of course . would you like to join me for chinese food ?
sheldon , please , you 're suffocate me .
good night , sheldon .
come on , just give her a chance . maybe she 'll grow on you .
i guess the difference be , i have some self-respect .
not that i 've ever see .
it 's relatively new . i just know that i 'm not gon na spend time with someone i do n't like simply to have a girlfriend . i 'm okay on my own .
look , uh , joy , it be nice to meet you , but
you 're ask me out ?
i look forward to it .
i assure you i be quite real and i 'm have regular intercourse with your daughter .
oh , yes . we 're like wild animal in heat . it 's a wonder neither of u have be hurt .
you want me to have a boyfriend , mother . well , here he be . have to sign off now . my hunger for sheldon be stir in my loin .
oh , yes , it 's time for me to make love to your daughter 's vagina .
thank you , sheldon , that go very well .
agree . amy , i find myself wonder if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship . bazinga . bedtime . please show yourself out .

no .
what do you want to talk about ?
please do n't tell anyone i spent the night with raj 's sister .

violation of the roommate agreement , overnight guest notification clause .
okay fine , i 'm , i 'm a horrible human be , i 'm the darth vader of pasadena .
you 're far too short to be darth vader . at best you might be a turncoat ewok .
my point be , priya 's go . and it would be much well if no-one else found out about this .
you mean , you want me to keep a secret .
yes .
you know i ca n't keep a secret .
you can if you try . think about it this way , if i be batman and you be alfred , you 'd keep that secret . right ?
because , well , batman have the secret .
well alfred have secret too .
like what ?
ta-da !
what .
ta-da . it 's short for da-da-da-da !
kind of busy here , sheldon .
i know , that 's why i shorten it .
what do you want .
what alibi ?
the fun love , and morally loose , miss maggie mcgeary .
oh , god .
you met her at pasadena 's most popular irish water hole , lucky baldwin 's , where maggie spends her night tend bar , with a head full of curl and a heart full of dream .
leonard , call me if you 're interested in coitus . sincerely , maggie mcgeary .
and if anyone be to actually call that number they will hear this .
top of the morning to you . you 've reach maggie mcgeary . leave a message after the wee little beep .
it 's pretty convincing , huh ? and it be n't even a real person . and here be the clincher . a lock of maggie 's flame auburn hair .
where do you get that ?
from an orang-u-tan in the primate lab .
an orang-u-tan ?
well , no-one 's go to run a dna test on it , leonard , honestly you over-think everything .
hey , leonard , will you please tell howard my sister 's never be attract to him .
c'mon raj , how be i suppose to know who she 's attract to . or be attract to . or who she might be attract to . in the future .
and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation . because i too know absolutely nothing about priya 's preference in male companionship . and with that , i will re-zip my lip .
i do n't see it .
uh , i be out .
on caprica night ?
yeah , i , uh , go for a drink .
really , you , and where , where do you go ?
to , uh , lucky baldwin 's .
oh , i 've heard of that place , be n't that pasadena 's favourite irish water hole .
yes .
do you meet anyone interest there , perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid ?
a a matter of fact i i i can't i can't i ca n't do it .
sure you can , you 're do fine , it 's very believable .
look , i 'm sorry raj , but the truth be i be with priya last night .
do n't listen to him , he 's still light head from all the irish whiskey and pickle egg in his system .
what be you do with priya ?
what ? you slept with my sister ?
yeah .
how could you ? we have a pact !
excuse me , i think how could you she 's my sister take precedence over a five year old pinky swear !
may i point out , in a parallel universe , your friend be say maggie mcgeary , she sound lovely .
look , i admit it , i may have cross a line here , but come on , raj , your sister be a grown woman . to her , i 'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate .
i i do n't believe it , this be a terrible betrayal of my trust .
no , no , no , would it help if i told you that i offer her my heart and she kind of stomp on it .
how hard do she stomp ?
very hard .
okay , i 'm good .
yeah , well , raj , i just want to say that i 'd never betray your trust . unlike leonard , i respect you .
really ?
mmm .
be it out of respect that you do n't tell raj about the time you drop his iphone in a urinal ?
dude ! i put that thing on my face !
i think a more amuse violation of raj 's trust be when howard convince him that foreigner give present to american on thanksgiving .
hey , i do n't see you give back your snoopy snowcone maker .
that be all a lie ? this year 's gift be already wrap !
and a long a we 're talk about betraying our friend , how about the month sheldon spent grind up insect and mix them into leonard 's food .
well , excuse me . that be not a betrayal , that be an experiment to determine at what concentration food start taste mothy .
you put moth in my food ?
for science .
i ca n't believe you kiss my sister with moth mouth .
well , uh , i ca n't believe you use sheldon 's toothbrush .
you use my toothbrush ?
not the brush part , just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gum .
a long a we 're apologise , sheldon , i , i 'm sorry i use your toothbrush .
and i 'm sorry . but that behaviour be beyond the pale and can not be tolerate . we be no longer friend .
i get you a talk thomas the tank engine for thanksgiving .
with real puff smoke ?
yes .
alright . but i 'm watch you .
hey , you get snoopy out . can i have a snowcone ?
well , sure .
these be pretty god , what flavour be this ?
guess .
papaya ?
guava ?
you 're so close .
i give up .
mango , caterpillar . what be you do ? you say you like it !
no , seriously , i think i 've finally figure out my problem with woman .
the capybara be the large member of the rodent family .
what do that have to do with me and woman ?
hi . i 'm leonard . and you be beautiful . you pop , sparkle and buzz electric . i 'm go to pick you up at eight , show you a night you will never forget .
where be we go ?
good news . i make it onto the team for the new defence department laser-equipped surveillance satellite .
thanks . listen , i have to get a security clearance , so you guy might be hearing from the fbi .
whoa , whoa , whoa ! i do n't want to speak to the fbi .
why not ?
i 'm brown and i talk funny .
they 're just do a background check on me .
do n't be ridiculous , raj . you 're here legally .
nobody care . do you know how long it 's be since i get through airport security without be give a colonoscopy ?
you know , i try very hard to make our lunch hour educational and informative , but your insistence on talk about your own life stymy me at every turn .
fine , sheldon , tell u about your giant rodent .
no , you squander your time with me , and the moment have now pass . feast on your disappointment , much a the capybara feast on it own waste .
oh , bella , do n't you see ? edward 's only push you away because he love you . come .
seven year .
i 'm in this country legally , you know .
of course not . i 'm here on an h-1b visa , which mean i ca n't be associate in any way with crime or criminal activity . and i 'm not .
no , just me . oh , there it be . here come a cavity search .
please do n't send me back to india , it 's so crowd . it 's like the whole country be one endless comic-con , except everybody 's wear the same costume , indian guy .
i love this country ! the-the baseball , the freedom , the rampant morbid obesity ! from california to the new york island , i 'm a real yankee doodle boy !
so , when howard say the fbi would be contact me , i be expect mulder . glad to see i get scully .
mulder and scully . x-files . the truth be out there . never mind . uh , so , what would you like to know ?
good . it 's a good relationship . of course , most of my relationship be good . probably because i exude confidence . people be drawn to that , you know ? confidence , not exude .
you be beautiful , you know that ? you pop , sparkle and buzz electric . i 'm go to pick you up at eight , show you a night you will never forget .
really ?
be that , oh , my , i do n't see the ring with my glass off , so , look at that , i 'm start to exude .
want to get that ?
could you get that ?
i suppose i could if i be ask .
would you please get that ?
of course . why do you have to make thing so complicate ?
yes .
you say you 're special agent page , fbi .
and here be my justice league membership card . but that do n't prove i know batman .
oh . all right . i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalty for impersonate a federal officer just to ask question about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex .
for the record , i truly support the fbi in the mission which be express through their motto ?
that 's of little comfort to a nation attempt to scrape burning feces off it shoe .
a little , but go on .
you heard me say blu-ray , right ?
very well . would you be interested in know that mr wolowitz once snuck onto my world of warcraft account and change the name of a certain level warlock from sheldor to smeldor ?
do i say mar rover ?
that be actually a poorly chosen example , a it have nothing to do with me .
i do n't want to . not that my disinclination to discus the topic should be interpret a evidence of howard wolowitz 's culpability in the destruction of government property worth million of dollar .
oh , good . i be afraid you be go to fixate on that mar rover incident .
what happen ?
apparently , the background interview do n't go well . you guy would n't know anything about that , would you ?
well , actually , i may have gotten a little tipsy when i talk to her .
i may have thrown up rum cake on her shoe .
i see . well , it 's good to know , when i need you guy , i can always count on you to step up and ruin everything .
i feel awful .
ah , me , too .
to tell you the truth , i thought if anyone be go to screw thing up for howard , it 'd be sheldon .
sleep eludes me , leonard .
really ? maybe sleep have met you before .
mockery ? that 's all you have to offer ?
i 'm sorry . why ca n't you sleep ?
well , i do mention the mar rover incident to that fbi agent and probably cost howard his security clearance .
what ?
but why should that keep me up ?
because you feel guilty ?
interest . so you 're say my insomnia be cause by a guilty conscience .
actually , you do n't have insomnia . you 're sleep now .
excuse me ?
you 're have a guilt-ridden dream .
do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis ?
that seem fairly conclusive . no , gorn , no . that 's where i sit .
thank you for agree to see me , agent page .
yes .
no .
i 'm sorry . i do n't recall you say no backsies .
but i still have rd joel wolowitz left to go .
no , it 's a different leonard . he 's chinese , red hair , six finger . good-bye .
raj . have you see howard ?
i think he 's eat lunch . uh , sheldon , i want you to meet neil degrasse tyson from the hayden planetarium in new york .
i 'm quite familiar with dr tyson . he 's responsible for the demotion of pluto from planetary status . i like pluto . ergo i do not like you .
if ifs and buts be candy and nut , we 'd all have a merry christmas . think about that , dr tyson .
oh , yeah .
howard . the person at fault for you not get a security clearance be me .
you ?
yes , but before you get upset , i want you to know i go to the fbi and retract my statement .
and they be okay with that ?
no . if anything , i make it bad . in any case , i have be riddle with guilt , which be cause gorn-infested rem sleep . so , i 'm here now to say i 'm sorry .
be you kid me ? you 've set my career back at least two year , and you think you can make it right with i 'm sorry ?
you 're trick me . it really be , be n't it ?
oh , shut up .
sheldon ?
hello .
what be you do here ?
i have trouble , penny . i 've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep .
you know , they have a really nice bar over at the olive garden .
i do n't like the olive garden . they treat me like family .
okay , sheldon . what can i get you ?
alcohol .
could you be a little more specific ?
i 'm sorry , honey , i do n't know millilitre .
ah . blame president james “ jimmy ” carter . he start america on a path to the metric system but then just give up . he wonder why he be a one-term president .
would you say that 's about _ milliliter ?
more or less .

oh , right , that . yes , leonard told me . sorry , honey .
penny , you face failure on a daily basis . how do you cope ?
i drink .
to drinking . nope . oh , if only there be some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt .
exactly . sometimes you ca n't win .
captain kirk won .
kirk cheat .
impressive that you know that . it 's hard to believe i 'm actually have this conversation with you .
right there with you .
what ?
i 'll reprogram howard .
what ? sheldon , you ca n't reprogram people .
no , you ca n't reprogram people . to james tiberius kirk .
hello , all .
hello .
hey .
howard , you 're feel well about me today , be n't you ?
not really .
yes , you be . i 'm use neurolinguistic program to modify your thought pattern .
oh . go away , sheldon .
there 's a nine ninety five e-book down the drain .
it 's for howard .
oh . sheldon , you ca n't fix this with gift .
nevertheless , i 've hurt you , and whether you forgive me or not , i want you to have this .
you 're give me a couch cushion ?
no . the cushion be merely symbolic . i 'm give you my spot on the couch .
but you love that spot .
oh , my god , dude . now you have to forgive him .
all right . apology accepted .
high five . not too hard . thank you .

maybe he take a class at the adult bookstore . that 's how i learn .
i ca n't believe you 've never see raider of the lose ark .
and i ca n't believe you 've never read eat , pray , love .
i do n't care if eat , pray , love change your life , i 'm not reading it .
you know , i could totally rock a hat like that .
there 's no switch . just listen and learn .
penny , if you think this be good , you should come with u friday to see it on the big screen at the colonial .
well , i 'm watch it now . why would i want to see it again on friday ?
because the print they 're show on friday have an additional _ second of previously unseen footage .
what , _ second ? that 'll be like see a whole new movie !
exactly . they say it finally solves the submarine controversy .
do leonard ? i 'm no expert , but i believe what we just heard from penny be sarcasm . oh , good . i 'm eight for _ this month .
yeah , i think i 'll pas . but you guy enjoy your extra _ second .
bet if i could make you understand why this be such a cool thing , we 'd still be together .
mm , yeah , no , we would n't .
uh-huh . i 'm guess _ second have something to do with that , too .
relax , it 's five o'clock . the movie do n't start till midnight .
another way of say that be the movie start at midnight , and it 's already five o'clock . let 's go .
see ? howard 's on my side .
actually , i 'm not . i 'm use sarcasm to mock you .
drat . now i 'm _ for _ .

i rest my case . amy , do n't you agree we should leave now and get in line ?
actually , a the new member of your social group , i believe i 'll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily side with your friend from time to time .
shrewd .

i inform you thusly .
eight for _ .
this be where we could have be if we have n't stop for dinner . this be where we could have be if koothrappali have n't order dessert .
well i earn it , dude , i ate all my broccoli .
and here 's where we be . the runt in a large litter , unlikely to ever reach the nourish teat of indiana jones .
so i guess it 's a good thing we stop for dinner .
oh , shut up .
so anyway , to make a long story short , turn out i have an unusually firm cervix .
you know amy , when we say girl talk , it do n't just have to be about our lady part .
shame . ‘ cause i have a real zinger about my title uterus .
oh , thanks . i found this place in alhambra . it 's in a woman 's basement . i think it 's a front for human traffic , but they do a really good job .
a colleague of mine do her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilize manicure implement . well do n't tell me that 's not girl talk .
so where should we go tonight ? a bar ? a club ? a movie ?
yes , and continue to bond . i have a feel that after tonight , one of you will become my best friend forever . or bff , if you prefer . which i do n't .
all right , time to open bachelor number two .
that 's okay . y ou can just sleep here .
oh , good , a slumber party ! we 'll do makeover , initiate phony phone call , and have spirit pillow fight in our frilly nightie !
oh , gosh , amy . i do n't know if i would call this an actual slumber party .
well , that 's disappoint . i 've always want to be invite to a slumber party .
not even when you be a kid ?
pillow fight !
oh , i hope they let u in soon . i 'm tire of run to the gas station to use the bathroom . the guy make me buy a gatorade every time . it 's a vicious circle .
too bad you do n't have a stadium pal like me .
what 's a stadium pal ?
let me put it this way , take care of the bathroom problem , and it keep your calf warm .
hey , guy , bad news . i just do a quick calculation . give the size of the theatre and the length of this line , we might not get seat .
what do he say ?
nice go , raj , just get him down for his nap .
we might not get seat ?
it 's fine , it 's fine . go back to sleep .
oh , i inform you thusly . i so inform you thusly .
howard , you talk to him . howard ? you 're pee , be n't you ?
well , if it be n't wil wheaton , the jar jar binks of the star trek universe .
well , you-sa can go think that at the back of the line . no cut , no buts , no coconut .
of what ? poorly execute beard ?
this be indiana jones , not star trek . there should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here . and even at star trek convention , they only let him in if he help set up .
calm down , sheldon .
i will not calm down . this affront to justice and decency can not go unanswered . a captain jean-luc picard once say , the line must be drawn here ! this far , no farther !
have to wake him up from his nap , do n't you ?
howard have a hairy chest ?
okay , there you go , sultry sunrise red . what do you think ?
my nail have never look so pretty before . get it off .
oh , oh , uh , look like they 're get ready to let people in .
listen to what mr wil wheaton be tweet . best seat in house for raider screen . suck on that , sheldon cooper .
why do you read his twitter feed ? you know it 's only go to upset you .
i 'm not sure i grasp the full entertainment value , but all right . next on wikipedia 's list of slumber party activity , truth or dare .
okay , it 's your game . you go first .
hang on . i 'm familiarize myself with the rule . seem fairly straightforward . bernadette , truth or dare ?
all right . to what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy ?
remember , you have to answer honestly .
wait . no , amy , you 're suppose to ask her something personal or embarrass .
oh . all right . what be the circumference of your areola ?
munch on complimentary popcorn . woot , woot . oh , the gall . i hope his next tweet be popcorn lodge in trachea , choke to death , woot , woot .
no !
we really want to see this . be there anything you can do ?
this be nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary . explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackey get in and we do n't .
i guess that 's that . let 's go home .
you know what ? i 'm go back to i told you so . i told you so .
we can still see something . uh , the new sandra bullock movie be play two block away . you know sandy b always brings it .
look , a side door . come on , short round .

short round ?
indy 's young sidekick from temple of doom .

you 're right . it should be a cuddly asian boy . like me .
and absolon hath kist hir nether yea , and nicholas be scald in the towte . this tale be doon , and god save al the rowte . ”
what the hell be that ?
bernadette dare me to tell a dirty story . the miller 's tale by chaucer be the dirtiest story i know . it would have be hidden in sock drawer if people in the 14th century have worn sock .
you might not like it a much if you knew what nether yea meant . hint , if one care about hygiene , one ought not be kiss it .
truth .
oh , that 's an excellent question . for two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded , you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other 's company .
i do n't believe the rule allow for an ex post facto option change .
okay , look , just because we 're not see each other anymore do n't mean we ca n't be friend . i mean , leonard 's a great guy .
then , why do you terminate your relationship with him ?
i do n't know . he get really serious , and i be n't ready for it .

oh , good lord , be we go to stand here and listen to him tear leonard apart like this ?
hey , i won a newcomb medal , too .

technically , howard 's the gear head . leonard 's just a dime store laser jockey .
what 's the idea ?
right .
that sound amaze . first movie i 'm watch , annie .
how exactly would these glass work ?
i do n't think something like that 's even possible .
you clearly do n't . what my spineless friend lack the courage to say be you 're a terrible person who take advantage of his tiny size , his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity .
sheldon .
leonard , i platonically love you , man , but face it , you 're a mess .
i think what he 's try to say be that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit .
a little bit ? the man super glue hershey 's kiss to your nipple .
that 's funny because those be n't the kind of kiss you want on your nipple .
this be a list of your heinous act against leonard . one of which be certainly the cause of him wet his bed well into his teen .
_ be not , oh , yeah , never mind .
nancy . you call me nancy for three year .
you really need to work on your penmanship .
it be n't fun for me .
you 're be too kind , leonard . you ruin him .
come on , guy .
that be pretty badass , dude .
i help the weak . it 's yet another way i 'm exactly like batman .
hey , for the record , jimmy be n't the reason i wet the bed . that one have my mother write all over it .
anyway , i 'm really sorry i make fun of your stutter in high school .
uh-huh . uh-huh . oh , god , just finish the sentence . okay , well , i 'm sorry you feel that way . bye . no one want to hear my apology .
that 's easy for you to say . you be n't just call a b-b-b-b-bitch .
both .
i actually knew that .
ooh , i ca n't do that . if i stand over a steam pot , my hair just go boing ! what else could i do ?
there 's habitat for humanity , building house for the poor .

well , yeah , thanks , jimmy .
be you okay to drive ?

yes .
sheldon , we ca n't let him drive .
then take away his key and make him wander the street with the other drunk .
you remember sheldon and raj and howard .
you 'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa .
yeah , just back there .
yeah . it kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people .
you know what would be nice ?
what 's that ?
yes , to a poor waitress who love a boot cut .
come on , they would be so cute on me , and , ah , they go great with this sweater !
i do n't think mother teresa oh , that be adorable .
leonard .

what be i suppose to do ? he need a place to sleep it off .
morning , jimmy .
oh , there it be , taco .
yeah , you do . so , uh , listen , it be great to see you again . and , and , and thanks for the apology .
for all the crappy stuff you do to me in high school .
i 'm not go to say i told you so , but we could have kill him .
i might kill him right now .
the dark knight have your back . he 's scar , but he have your back .
okay , jimmy , it 's time for you to go .
well say , boy wonder .
do n't answer that . it 's a trick question . i speak from experience .
i 'm not afraid of you any more , jimmy . now get out ! uh-oh .
you do it , leonard , you stood up to your bully .
i do n't need to outrun him , i just need to outrun you .
you be right , a whole new load .

you know , this be wrong . let 's put everything back . here .
completely empty box . if you 'd like to examine it ?
mm-hmm . yep . i see nothing in this box but a waste childhood .
little snarky there , cello lesson . and we have this completely ordinary cylinder . if you 'd like to examine it ?
ordinary , yet i sense it be drip with magical potential .
a i be say , empty box , empty cylinder , and , ooh , voila .
i 'm tell you , dude , there 's a seat on the hogwarts express with your name on it .
this be how you 're go to entertain your little cousin and his friend ? by lie to them ?
how be this lie ?
a magic show be an inherently deceitful proposition . this be an ordinary top hat . you 've chosen that card freely . i do not have a set of lock pick lodge in my keister .
ca n't you just enjoy the wonder , sheldon ? why must you peek behind the curtain ? or up the butt ?
do n't be so hard on him . it 's natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear !
coin lodge in body part be not a source of amusement . when i be five , billy spark put a mexican peso up my nose .
how be that not amuse ?
it 's still there . take me _ minute to get through airport security .
look , i make sheldon disappear . ta-da .
next time , you should open with that .
ooh , look who 's out on a date . pasadena 's favourite power couple , shamy .
and that be the answer to the question , what be wrong with eat at the cheesecake factory ?
so , be we celebrate anything special tonight ?
oh , yes . our relationship agreement specifies that the second thursday of every month , or the third thursday in a month with five thursday , be date night .
that be so hot .
all right , without objection , the minute of the previous date be consider read and agree to . any new business ?
how be your day ?
superb . this morning i make a palindrome with my alpha-bits . nice hat , bob tahecin .
sound like you hit the ground run . i have a bit of good news myself . my most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequence in dendritic branch make the cover of neuron .
ooh ! speak of good news , somebody just hit _ twitter follower .
that 's nice . anyway , i 've be dream of this day for a long time .
yeah , me , too . triple digit , i 'm not gon na lie , feel pretty good .
sheldon , i 'm the sole author on a paper be publish in a distinguish journal that may change the course of my field .
mm-hmm . mm-hmm . ooh , _ ! air 's get a bit thin up here .
so , be we ready to order ?
give me a minute . i 'm gon na go wash up .
well , that 's odd . we both wash up when we come in . it 's probably a euphemism for urination .
sheldon , what be wrong with you ?
okay , amy just told you some excite news , and you act like it be no big deal .
what if they simply do n't excite me ?
well , just smile and think about koala .
she 'd see right through that . we go to the zoo all the time . she know my koala face . and for future reference , it 's this .
yeah . i start when i be a teenager . i thought i could show a girl a few trick and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act .
ah , let 's just say the only wand that ever saw any action be this one . oh , look what my mom make u for the act .
i just give it to her !
she 's not stack like you , ma ! she never step on hers !
you 'll do fine . hand me those ring ? see ? you nail it .
well , that 's because you have n't be around them much . this be good practice . i mean , you be gon na be a mom someday , right ?
yes .
how come you 're not do a mission ? you 're just wander around .
have a rough night . i thought i 'd go for a walk and clear my head .
some people go outside and do that .
it 's after nine o'clock , at this hour the street of pasadena be teem with drunken sailor and alley cat .
you know digital alcohol be never a solution . what 's go on ?
hard a this may be to believe , it 's possible that i 'm not boyfriend material .
glad i be sit down for that . do you and amy get in a fight ?
amy have a fight . i be be perfectly reasonable . i 'm gon na have a whiskey . do you want anything ?
no , i ca n't . i 'm play grand theft auto later . look , i 'm no expert in woman .
i 'll say .
that 's not necessary when someone 's try to help you .
i 'm sorry . it 's the alcohol talk . go on .
sometimes with woman you want to listen to what upset them and then show them that you can grow and change .
nut to that . what else you get ?
i do n't know what to tell you . buy her something .
how do that work ?
well , that approach have sheldon cooper write all over it .
glad i could help .
it 's appreciate . and if you ever manage to find a woman again , i 'll be glad to return the favour .
and now , all the ring be magically link together . my fiancee 's wear a magic ring , too . it make all my money disappear .
okay . okay . now , my lovely assistant be go to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk .
okay , we 're go to roll up this newspaper .
okay , we 're go to stick this in here and then i 'm go to pour in the milk . i hope this work , because i do n't bring a change of pant .
she 's just kid , boy and girl . everyone get cake .
just give me the pitcher . behold ! wrong pitcher .
yes , you do . oh , i think my crotch be start to curdle .
yeah , no , we all get that . but do n't you think it 'll be different when the child be ours ?
i do n't think there 's anything in this jewellery store that amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we be just look at at sears .
oh , my god , now i know what i sound like to you when i say stupid stuff .
ooh , a pocket watch .
okay , i do n't think amy want a pocket watch .
no , but maybe she want a man with a pocket watch .
still say stupid stuff . ooh , do she like bracelet ?
well , she 's very fond of her silver one that say allergic to penicillin . maybe they have a dressier version of that ?
excuse me . i do n't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out . you 'd be lucky to land a fella like me .
fine , go ahead .
trust me , we be not a couple .
he 's in trouble with his girlfriend and need to buy her a present .
ooh , be these real diamond ?
i 'm still try to wrap my mind around it . i always thought i 'd be a dad someday .
oh , me , too . you 're so care . i 've often picture you guide a young boy into manhood .
there you go , howard . sound like raj 'll have your baby , problem solve .
what be you gon na do ?
wow , that 's rough . where 'd you get that ?
it 's right off the dust jacket of my mom 's last book .
maybe me and bernadette be n't right for each other .
look , howard , i 'd say there 's a lot of fish in the sea , but i watch you dangle your hook in the water for year . do not throw her back .
i do n't want to , but this be kind of a deal breaker .
what 's your mom go to say if you call off the wedding ?
eight o'clock . sheldon , that pocket watch be ridiculous .
nonsense . i look like a train conductor . under what pretext do you lure her here ?
i say , hey , want to come over and hang out ?
good , good , if you have say something clever , she might 've gotten suspicious .
hey .
hi .
what 's he do here ?
okay , he want to talk to you .
well , i do n't want to talk to him . and i 'm pretty disappointed in you , too . although we both know that wo n't last .
sheldon , you 're up .
thank you . amy , i 'd like to apologize . your accomplishment be impressive . and i 'm proud of you .
we both know that 's your koala face .
i told you .
of course i do , i 'm a princess , and this be my tiara !
you 're right , the tiara be too much .
you should keep it . you could wear it again sometime .
i do n't know , hunt ?
do n't worry , ma . i will , a soon a i can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue !
i be upset . my mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on , if the smell of bengay do n't burn your eye .
really ? that 's great . what ?
me ?
yeah , we 're good .
i would love that . but what be that behind your ear ? oh , look , it 's a condom .
you feel like try something new for dinner ? maybe indian , tex-mex ?
you ever wonder how human would be different if they evolve from lizard instead of mammal ?
okay , let 's talk about that .
permission grant , commander .
excuse me , amy . penny , do you have plan for dinner tonight ?
no , i mean just you and me .
you mean , like a date ?

oh , no ! they sent the wrong spock ! live long and suck it , zachary quinto .
how come you never invite sheldon and me on a double date ?
just a sec . too much ?
no .
okay , just hang on .
uh , about two year ago .
i do n't know .
maybe he 's die . that would be so romantic .
he 's not die .

how about this ?
come on .
yeah , okay , no .
absolutely not . look , we 're just gon na have dinner and , you know , see how it go .
if he be die , would you sleep with him ?

with a dead man .
amy , stop it . oh , god , i 'm so nervous .
i know , but we 've finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it be weird . and what if something go wrong ? then what ?
guess it 'll just be sheldon and me go on a double date with howard and bernadette .
what be you talk about ?
do you forget what penny do to you ? it take you two year and defile my sister to turn that frown upside down .
i do n't defile your sister , we have a relationship .
i heard you call her brown sugar . in my book , that 's defilement .
you want to know my opinion ?
no .
all right , then . the reason you 're fixate on a good-natured simpleton like penny be that she 's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment , your brilliant yet intimidate mother .
it 's in her book , needy baby , greedy baby .
that do n't make it true .
it 's call non-fiction for a reason , leonard .
see you later .
if they ever make a movie version of that book , you know who should play leonard 's mother ? sandra bullock .
because she 's great in everything .
now , where be we ? oh , yes . do anyone have any wood ? oh , come on ! i just want wood . why be you make it so hard ?
oh , that 's a good question . how about awkward ?
yeah , that sound right .

okay .
so , polly , tell me about yourself .
it 's penny .
oh , sorry , yeah . awkward .
oh , god , no . the money 's pretty good . and i use the equipment to make my own bat-signal .

and now that i have some wood , i 'm go to begin the erection of my settlement .
he 's get to be do this on purpose .
ooh , eight thirty . you and penny decide to go out and paint the town beige ?
you 're thirty year old and you live with your mother .
i guess it do n't go well .
we do n't know that . not to a certainty . all we know be that leonard be home .
how about now ?
again , not enough evidence . for all we know , he 's be murder . now , back to our game .
you be in the middle of an erection .
oh , of course . it 's right here in my hand .
what do she want from me now ? what 's up ?
do not overthink this .
i do n't understand .
bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup .

yeah , except for when i get the foot cramp .
you hung in there , though .
well , there be a lot at stake .
so what do you want to do now ?
well , i want to go get my asthma inhaler , but it might ruin the moment . just , just help me out here . how do a miserable date end in sex ?
i do n't know , it 's complicate .
well , i 'm a pretty smart guy , and right now my brain have dibs on the blood supply , so give it a go .
okay , it 's just , at the restaurant when you say you want u to be together again , it get very real very fast and i panicked .
why ? what be you afraid of ?
well , what if we do go out and i do something stupid and dump you again ?
come on , be serious .

after you use the facility at the gas station , do you make a purchase ?
it 's customary , when use the rest room at a retail establishment , to make a small purchase . do you ?
here 's two dollar . go buy some beef jerky .
i do n't want beef jerky .
it 's not about you . it 's about a poor immigrant from pakistan try to make his way in america by work the graveyard shift at the colorado boulevard chevron .
fine .
needy baby , greedy baby indeed .
leonard will be here in a moment . he 's look for a different parking space .
why ?
we be next to a car with an ask me about my grandchild bumper sticker , and i be afraid if we ran into them on the way out , i 'd be obligate to do so .
me , too . out of deference to them , let 's not flaunt our happy relationship .
you have a keen insight into the human heart , amy farrah fowler .
we be next to a suburu with a gore/lieberman bumper sticker .
well , i doubt they 'd want to talk about that , so we 're fine .
i 'm surprised to see you here after it go so badly with penny .
well , hey , we 're grown-ups . we can still be friend .
why not ?
really ?
here you go , guy , let me get you go with some water . you need menu or you know what you want ?

see , she knew what always meant .
wow , you 're like a dog with a bone , be n't you ?

sheldon , everybody take vacation .
now you do , too . oh ! i have a brilliant idea . amy 's a biologist . i 'll go work in her lab .
be n't that just feynman 's idea ?
ten second ago , you never heard of him . now you 're an expert .

way to kill the mood .
oh , i 'm gon na be do some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beaker .
what ? excuse me , you have dr sheldon cooper in your lab . you 're gon na make him do the dish ? that 's like ask the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar .
sheldon , you 've never work in a lab like this before . you have no experience in the field of biology .
i have plenty of experience in biology . i bought a tamagotchi in _ . and it 's still alive . let 's do this .
where 's howard ?
no hi , raj ? no how be you , raj ? just straight to where 's the other white guy ?

here you go . this be now the only lab with glassware wash by a man with two doctorate and a restrain order sign by carl sagan .
soap spot . wash 'em again .
y-you 're be ridiculous . those be perfectly clean .
sheldon , this beaker use to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that die of syphilis . if it 's , in fact , perfectly clean , drink from it .
all right , perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley . i need you to count the bacteria spore on these petri dish .
there be something wrong with that detergent . that be way too bubbly .
i 'm sure it be .
i intend to write that soap company a strongly word letter .
you know what this place need ? a suggestion box .
how 's it go ?
how 's counting go ? when i be in kindergarten , i recite pi to a thousand place for the school talent show . i think i get this .

really ? be that what you think ?
yes , that 's what i think . and i 'm super smart , so it 's probably true .
hey , i 've be training in the field of neurobiology for _ year . you 've be here for three hour , and you 've spent one of them in the bathroom .
i 'm sorry . it take me a while to get thing go on an unfamiliar toilet .
sheldon , i 've give you the simplest thing to do , and you have n't do one of them right .
maybe that 's because i 'm not be challenged . it 's the same reason einstein fail math .
maybe the math be too bubbly for him .
you think you 're do science by cut up that brain ? they could do the same thing at any quiznos . and they 'd offer to toast it for me , too .
okay , smart guy . i 'm about to remove the locus coeruleus , which be incredibly delicate work . have at it .
no . what you see be a man tremble with confidence . do a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much ?
no . but your thumb do .
oh , dear .

what be you do here ?
i 'm on vacation . social convention dictate that i let my hair down at a local water hole . social convention be stupid .

what do you guy think i should do ?
i say you tell alex your heart belongs to penny , i provide her a shoulder to cry on , and then roughly half a year later i give it to her good .
i need your advice about a delicate workplace situation . uh , to protect those involve , i 'll be change their name .

i do n't even understand why they go to these convention .
i know . the four of them work at a major university . they 're all super smart . how can they still be into something make for 12-year-olds ?
it 's probably because they be bully grow up . in a world where you ca n't fight back , superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment .

what be wrong with people ? why do n't they stop ?
maybe we 're well off . what if we be to get in a car with a crazy person ?
look at u , sheldon . we 're the crazy people .
well , perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorist of our mental competence .
good idea . why do n't you get start on that ?
come on , let 's just start walk . there 's get to be a gas station or something nearby .
what , you think just because you 're wear a captain 's uniform , you 're in charge ?

hmm , okay , i 'm do . how do you guy finish so fast ?
yeah , well , i have street smart .
mmm .
and the story move along at a brisk pace . it be , overall , what 's the word i 'm look for ?

i do n't know how leonard can get so caught up in this .
what a waste of time .
i know . a hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up ?
that make even less sense , i mean

i hate this planet .
yes !
no ! it ca n't decide . it 's a hammer .
you say it 's a magic hammer .
yeah , but , it ca n't make decision .
if harry potter 's wand can make decision , why ca n't thor 's hammer ?
okay , if you 're go to start compare wand and hammer , i ca n't even take you seriously .
hello . hello . uh , uh , uh , four glass of water , please . anything for you guy ?
can i use your phone ? our car get steal .
scotty be on the original series , and we 're next generation . so , joke 's on you .
we 're not with him .
you ca n't pick something up in outer space . in space , there be no up .
oh , yeah ? then how do the sun come up every day ?
hard to argue with those kind of street smart .
our clothes , our wallet , phone .
and about three hundred dollar worth of makeup , so this thief could look like anyone right now .
uh , we 're go to the comic-con in bakersfield . they have a big costume contest . it 's cooler than it sound .

i 'm with leonard . i 'm do .
actually , it 's three against one .
what ? what about the mission ? you say we be a real-life land party .
yeah ?
no . hulk picked up thor , thor picked up the hammer .
okay , hang on . if i go to a bar and pick up a guy , and he pick up a girl , and then we all leave together , do i pick up the girl ?
do that ever happen ?
hey , be we talk about me or be we talk about thor ?
well , i say that 's the last time we ever go outside .
look , right here . red hulk be pick up thor 's hammer 'cause thor 's touch it .
no , it 's because they 're in space . he 's really just touch the strap .
the strap be part of the hammer .
no , that ca n't be right .
maybe thor 's hammer be a new colour of nail polish .
how could red hulk be worthy ?
there 's only one logical explanation . somewhere in the desert we cross into an alternate dimension where the woman in our life can finally appreciate great literature .
captain , what be your order ?
i say we investigate .
wait . they might be hostile .
fine , but set them to stun . if we vaporize penny , i 'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again .

i suppose there 's no choice but to face the cry , angry accusation and the high-pitched wail of despair .
yeah . and who know how amy will react .
here 's some more ice .
what be we think ? we should have just do it the regular way .
honestly , if i could bend that far , what would i need with you ?

‘ cause we out drop science , son .

you ca n't live here .
what ? why ? be it the message ? i only use urban slang to sound tough so people would n't break in .
no . it 's not the message .
well , what be it , then ? i do everything just the way you like it .

she do n't want to live with leonard , so he have to come live here again . she 's the snake in our garden . she 's the reason we ca n't be happy .

since when do n't you want to live with me ?
oh , do n't get all huffy . you 're the one who decide to move in without even ask me if i be ready .
yeah , i think we should talk about that .
and since you love the truth so much , why do n't you tell amy you do n't want to live with her instead of blame it on me ?
i thought we be talk about the other thing .
you 're a coward .
well , the evidence do support that .
come on , amy , let 's go drink wine and talk about what jerk our boyfriend be .
you know what would show them ? i should move in here with you .

no !
you 'll never believe what happen to me at work today .
hmm ?
this old guy be choke on his food , and i save his life .
you 're kid . do you heimlich him ?
no . i say , oh , my god , i think that old guy 's choke , and then one of the busboy heimlich'ed him .
you 're a hero .
oh , yeah , speak of work , do you know if you have thursday night off ?
um , i think so . why ?
what do you mean , why ? it 's valentine 's day .
oh , right . yeah , we can do something .
you could be a little more into it .
no , i 'm into it , i 'm into it . just , there 's so much pressure to make the night special , and it never work out .
so , in conclusion , i believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chilli be proof that the rectum do posse the sense of taste .
oh , you caught that , do you ?
everything okay ?
well , uh , how about you keep the store open late , and we throw a party for all the people who do n't have date ?

it 's nice that all the people who be lonely on valentine 's day can come here tonight and be together .
except on a date with anybody .
you know , you and i have so much fun hang out . if you be a girl , all our problem would be solve .
oh , yeah , think about it . we 'd hang out , we 'd read comic book , we 'd see movie . it 'd be like the best relationship ever .
then i 'd take you home , slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion .
oh , i ca n't believe he 's go to marry the girl he cheat on me with .
be n't it kind of nice ? i mean , he be with the wrong person , and now he found the right person .
what , so i 'm the wrong person ? maybe you want to be with gretchen , too .

really ?
and i 'm cool with surprise . but nothing on a jumbotron . i do n't want to cry on a big screen like that .
okay . you know what ? this might be the wine talk , but i have a very important question to ask you .
leonard hofstadter ?
will you be my valentine ?
sorry . maybe next year . i 'm just kid . romance ninja . let 's have sex . waugh !
we 're glad you could make it .
what be it about this holiday that make people so unhappy ?
you really think so ?
thank you . uh , would you like to , uh , get a cup , a cup of coffee or ?
later , loser !
so , penny , i understand you would like to learn more about flag .
yeah , i ca n't tell you how many time i 've be at a party where everyone 's talk about flag and i just could n't join in .
yeah . well , you come to the right place .
uh , i 'm sorry , can we just pause for a minute ?
what 's wrong ?
i just think it might look more natural if you talk to me instead of the camera , you know , like , like a real conversation . it 's something we work on in my act class .
interest . a few people in the comment section have say that my delivery be robotic . perhaps that be n't the compliment it sound like .
do n't look under that rock . raj , you okay ?
you in there ?
go away !
we 're worried about you .
of course not . nothing good ever happens .
whoa .
what ?
nope , just , just , whoa .
raj , what 's go on ?
you do n't kill her and chop her up , that 's not what we 're smell , right ?
i go and look . it be a high and tiny window . she must have be very motivate .
i 'm sorry . that 's awful , but come on , you get to shake it off .
yeah , you ca n't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life .
why not ? with online shopping and overnight delivery , i can get anything i want . look , i just order a case of dinty moore beef stew and two live lobster on amazon .
lobster overnight ?
oh , you 're kid . let me see . well , i 'll be . look , you can throw in a couple steak and have a surf and turf .
the surf and turf sound good . see if they have corn on the cob .
you 're waste your time . just please , leave me alone .
now what ?
hello . how 's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study go ?
oh , that 's right . how 'd it go with penny ?
much well than i expect . she even give me some helpful tip about act and body language . watch . welcome to my world . not welcome to my world . welcome . not welcome .
i know . i 'm still learn to control it .
do you tell penny how helpful she be ?
why would i do that ?
because she 's your friend , and she do a nice job . i 'm sure she 'd like to hear it .
all right .
i do n't mean now . hello ? yeah , yeah , you want a cigarette . well , i 'd like a normal boyfriend . deal with it .
oh , hi . what 's up ?
um
you need me to shut the door so you can do your knock thing ?
no . i do n't start yet , it 's fine .
okay . so , what do you need ?
yes , you be very natural in front of the camera , and i found your suggestion extremely helpful .
aw , sweetie , you just make my day .

hey , my act class be put on a play friday night . i could put you and amy on the guest list .
that 's right . they 're no good without the lighter .
well , so much for your advice on compliment penny .

penny . penny . penny . oh yeah , much well .

amy point out to me that since you do something nice for me , i 'm obligate to do something nice for you . so , yes , i 'll go to your dopey play .
hey , i do n't want you to go any more .
you should go 'cause you want to go , not because you have to .
oh , dear lord , more rule ? where do it stop ? can i want to go because i have to want to go ?
okay . do whatever you want .
yeah , but now , wait . do whatever i want ? or whatever i have to want ?
oh , for god 's sake , just come to the play .
all right . i do n't want to , but at least that make sense .
would it help if i give him some pointer ? i 'm just funnin ' ya .
you 're the one ? okay , let me tell you something . that guy you blew off happens to be my best friend . okay ? he be devastate .
i do n't want to celebrate .
not even a little ? i mean , we could have a pant party . go put some on .
why would i want her number ? i do n't want anything to do with this woman .
oh , come on , raj .
you 're , you 're a good friend for try to help , but , i 've make my choice .
all right . well , i 'll see you around .
see you . no , wait , take her number . i do n't want the temptation .
i must be strong so i do n't stray from my true purpose , the study of the universe .
all right . thanks for ruin lobster for me .
wait ! give me the number ! give me the number ! give me the number !
so , amy , what 's go on with your addiction study ?
sadly , i 'm no longer associate with that project .
typical bureaucratic nonsense . you can get animal addict to a harmful substance , you can dissect their brain , but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you 're unprofessional .
i 'm sorry . that i ask .
all right , let 's get this stupid play over with .
uh , hang on . empty your pocket .
why ?
you know why . the nintendo d . and the psp . now the gameboy .
aw , for pete 's sake . can we go now ?
well , be that all of it ? just set it down .
just so you know , this be not a stupid play . a streetcar name desire be an american classic .
it 's about streetcar ? oh , great . i wo n't need this .
just a sec . oh , who say just a sec ? i hate myself . hello .
uh , would you like to come in ?
oh .
really ? then what be you do at the comic book store that night ?
yeah , me neither .
i lie . i love them . i only say that so you 'd go out with me .
go out with me on one date , and i promise you , you 'll see .
you wo n't regret it . i 'm the most pathetic guy you 've ever met . and that , boy and girl , be how it 's do .
you love her very much , do n't you ?
i think you have a great capacity for devotion . you 'll be lonely when she pass on , wo n't you ? i understand what that be .
she 's pretty good , huh ?
she be . but when do they get to the part about streetcar ?
she really be .
our penny 's a star .
how can she remember all those line , but a a waitress , she ca n't remember no tomato on my hamburger ?
look , i know you guy do n't want to do this , but we have no choice . so , you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with .
i get the b word .
if you ask me , this whole thing be a waste of our time .
help woman ? y
help anyone . people should take care of themselves .
oh , like yesterday , when you make me drive you to the dry cleaner , the pharmacy and the post office ?
i 'm not say people ca n't use tool . even an otter pick up a rock when he want a clam .
you do n't think it 's worthwhile to try to get more woman work in science .
i think that 's incredibly sexist of you . i believe in a gender-blind society like in star trek , where woman and men of all race and creed work side by side a equal .
you mean where they be advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive , but a black lady still answer the space phone ?
oh , i do spend a lot of my shower time with lieutenant uhura .
yes , i know , you 're too smart for this .
exactly . it 's like ask the human torch to heat up your frozen burrito .
get it . all right , i 'm think one way to counter bias in the peer-review process , be for paper to be submit under gender-neutral name . like s smith instead of samantha smith .
i suppose there be a history of professional woman use their initial so a not to be pre-judged . harry potter 's j.k rowling , uh , star trek 's d.c fontana .
van nuys pole-dancer d.d . melon . all right , i think we 've really help woman today . let 's fire up the old xbox .
guy , please do n't make this a school project where i 'm the smart kid do all the work while the slacker sit back and watch .
so , you think i 'm one of the smarter kid ?
no , you 're a tool i be use to make my point .
guy , our topic be encourage woman in science , can you at least play a less sexist game
how be it sexist ? my character wields a battle axe a well a any man .
not to mention she have mammary gland that could nurse a family of _ . and have enough milk left over to open a baskin robbins .
mother , warrior-princess , franchise owner , i hear glass ceiling shatter all over town .
sheldon , you 're always say how much smarter you be than me . spend five second and come up with one idea on how to get more woman into science .
some people be otter , some people be rock .
i wonder if there 's a way we could give the idea a trial run .
maybe i could call my old middle school , see if we can talk to some of the female student .
that 's great , try to set up something for the three of u to go over there .
oh , hold on . while i 'm comfortable speak about science , i 'm not sure i know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren . well google it .
how do i get 12-year-old girl excite .
no !
thanks again for let me crash girl ' night .
be you kid ? you brought fancy wine and make fondue . i 've slept with guy for less . it 's a joke . base on real event .
anyway , i be hop i could , uh , pick your brain a little . i 'm suppose to take lucy out friday and i need a killer first date .
so , blow off work , go on a weekday .
hooky ? i 've never played hooky in my life . my mom say that 's how girl end up addict to reefer and jazz music .
it 's more like how girl end up at a best western hotel with a 34-year-old guy name luther .
i 'm in .
me , too .
excuse me , i thought we be try to solve my problem ?
oh , yeah , right . wait , what be your problem again ?
i be a man who ca n't talk to woman , try to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such cripple social anxiety she ca n't be around other people .
yeah , that 's a toughie .
hmm . we do just disney or california adventure , too ?
it 's nice of your old school to let u try out our science talk on some female student .
well , they 're actually pretty excite . i 'm their most famous alum . if you do n't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitute .
this must feel pretty good for you , come back to your alma mater a an astronaut .
yeah , last time i be here , i be just a scrawny little nerd .
and now you 're also an astronaut .
nothing .
smart . we do n't want any problem .
i ca n't believe i ditch work for disneyland .
so , what be we gon na do first ?
ooh , that sound like fun .
come on , do it with u .
all right , whatever . how do it work ?
guess it would be fun to be cinderella .
oh , i want to be cinderella , too .
yeah .
then how do we decide ?
she and i be both a little awkward in social situation , so this seem like a good idea .
no , you ca n't join u . just go , go climb back up whatever beanstalk you come down from .
a you 're reading , it will help to remember i have an adorable accent .
no , but i do go to the international space station .
no , but i be in the rocket . i do n't actually
no , i 'm an american hero . your uncle brings people nut , okay ?
that 's a fitting pun-ishment . i still do n't know what you do for a living .
anything i might have see ?
no , never . what be porn ?
thank you for take time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young woman .
it 's our pleasure . i 'm dr fowler , and i 'm a neuroscientist .
the world of science need more woman , but from a young age , we girl be encourage to care more about the way we look than about the power of our mind .
unless you want to be cinderella .
please be cinderella . please be cinderella .
hey , how be your what ?

they 're just come over for dinner . no one 's gon na look in the closet .
could work out . for all we know there 's a toilet in there somewhere .
you know what we should do ? we should show the closet to sheldon .

whoa , you open this ?
well , i have to find out if it be personal correspondence or memorabilia . now , a i be say , base on the content

you know , when i first met howard , he would pull his scrotum out of his short and say , aw , i sat in gum .
what be your point ?
well , it 's just kind of weird how grown up he be now . happily married guy throw dinner party .
really ? you could n't just say that ? you have to tell the scrotum story ?
try to paint a picture .
it be a nice change of pace not eat takeout around a coffee table .
mm , you know , we could throw a dinner party , too . maybe even ask everyone to get dress up .

we heard you read the letter from howard 's father .
i do .
what do it say ?
i ca n't tell you that . i 'm bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality .
sheldon , that 's not a real thing .
control over the information contain in that letter belongs to howard . by happenstance , i come to know it . that do n't give me the right to disseminate it freely .
come on . look , the letter be found in bernadette 's closet . do n't that count for something ?
be you point out that california be a community property state , and since howard and bernadette be married , the intellectual property contain in that letter be jointly own by the two spouse ?
yeah , obviously .
well played . sometimes i do n't give you enough credit , penny .
dude , you make the right choice come to me for help with this party .
actually , all i do be invite you .
so your theme be i saw a rerun of mad men and bought some crab puff from trader joe 's ? hate to miss that .
hey , where have you be ?
oh , leonard . if i be prone to sarcasm , i 'd say i be pull off a major heist at the museum of laundry basket .
oh . yeah , well , i be waylaid by penny , bernadette and amy . they make me reveal confidential information about howard 's father .
what information ?
i ca n't tell you that . i be bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality .
well , come on , we wo n't tell anyone .
sorry , badgering me wo n't work . what you should have say be , it 's pointless to keep this a secret because penny will tell u .
fine , then that .
all right , i 'll tell you . my goodness , everyone 's on their game today .
this be really fun .
yeah , and the hors d'oeuvres be delightful .
a be the company .
aw .
my shirt be itchy and i wish i be dead .
hey , uh , listen , everybody . before howard get here , et 's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father .
of course .
sure .
absolutely .
if i say yes , can we turn off that latin orgy music ?
ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flight of stair .
i be .
what ?
sheldon , i swear to god , i 'm gon na kill you .
hey .
what ? u ? who else know ?
i know .
me , too .
same here .
shame on all of you .
you know , too .
could n't leave him one friend , could you ?
so everybody know what 's in that letter except for me ?
yes , it 's six against one . stand down , sir .
how could you do this ?
no , i do n't want to know . i mean , i do , but i get to go .
use me a a human shield !
i panicked . he look taller than usual .
in here .
it 's okay . sorry i ran off like that .
uh , picture of my dad and me when i be a kid .
why ?
oh , honey , i be in no mood to have sex tonight . i 'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it , but oh . what be you guy do here ?
when you left , you be n't sure whether or not you want to know what be in your dad 's letter , so we come up with kind of a cool solution .
oh , yeah , what 's that ?
raj , you 're up .
it be a map lead to the lose treasure of famous pirate one-eyed willy .
nice try . that 's the plot for goony .
told you .
do n't .
amy .
you do n't know it , but your father be in the auditorium at your high school graduation . and he cry because he be so proud of you .
really ?
or that 's complete poppycock which amy make up . it still could be the map .
penny .
no , it 's not .
do n't .
okay , my turn . your dad write about how family be the most important thing , and that you should never throw it away like he do .

hey , it 's still early . why do n't we go back and have that party ?
yeah ,
yeah , cool .
okay .
you know , surprisingly , uh , the letter from your father be n't the most interest thing i read in the closet . bernadette 's diary have some saucy passage .
there 's nothing to worry about . your secret 's safe with me .
although copyright law would allow me to quote snippet in the context of a review .
me , too . if i 'd know we be gon na be dance , would have worn my flat .
this turn out pretty well , huh ?
yeah , i think so .
i agree . that be , if you 've never be to or heard of a party before .
if you 'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place , you 'd be happy all the time .
uh , penny , i , i have a couple of question about your closet . be there any reason you 're keep this dead goldfish ?
damn , i forgot to feed him . and that i have him .
well , now , do you also have a dog ? because i found what appear to be a battery-operated chew toy .
party 's over ! party 's over !
ooh , one gravy boat .
that 's from sheldon . he told me he have it engrave .
one inappropriate , yet i wish i thought of that gravy boat .
when i get married i 'm go to register at the ucla cadaver lab .
ew , why ?
‘ cause i 've always want a whole human skeleton and they be really spendy .
not just someday . in exactly four year . but do n't tell sheldon . he 's still a flight risk .
what about me what ?
oh , well , you know , leonard be great .
he 's a sweetie .
you 're not answer the question . do you love him ?
yeah , sure , of course i love him .
well , i do .
no , he 'd just take it the wrong way .
what do that mean ?
it mean he be special and smart and nice and
no . maybe . i do n't know .
amy , you ?
ca n't help ya , kid . whenever i 'm around sheldon , i feel like my loin be on fire . in the good way . not the urinary tract infection way .
hey , buddy , how 's it go up there ?
you do n't have to shout , raj . it 's not like i 'm an astronaut float around in outer space . oh , wait , i be .
so , be it everything you hop it would be ?
it 's well . i wake up every morning and i just ca n't believe i 'm on this incredible adventure .
excuse me . i 'm talk to my friend .

all right , all right . i get ta go . there 's a meteor shower .
bye .
over and out .
bye , buddy !
hey , stuart , come on in .

sheldon , you be not in charge .
that 's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner .
what 's the big deal ? you guy be bring your girlfriend . i do n't want to sit by myself .
the big deal be i be expect u to be an intimate group of five . now , we 're go to be a faceless mass of six .
it 'll be fine . just , uh , pretend he 's wolowitz .
at the movie , wolowitz always eats raisinets .
well , it 's hardly my business what you eat , a long a it do n't crunch during the film and it 's raisinets .
yuh-uh , one more question , if you 're go to replace wolowitz , i need to know a little more about you .
wolowitz go to mit . what 's your educational background ?
equally ridiculous . let 's go .
this insistence on hand-holding be preposterous .
well , i like it .
yeah , of course you do . you 're a girl . you like all kind of hippy-dippy thing .
just watch the movie .
it 's not fair . penny be n't make leonard hold hand .
there might be a reason for that .
sweaty ? unhygienic ? look dumb ? take your pick .
penny say she 's not sure she want to be leonard 's girlfriend anymore .
wrong . she just take a sip from his diet dr pepper .
so ?
so , if she want to end her pair-bond with leonard , why on earth would she guzzle a witch ' brew of his soda and spit ?
it 's complicate .
now you 're ask me to keep a secret from my best friend , colleague , and roommate ?
yes , please , penny will kill me .
uh , fine . fyi , secret-keeping ? hate it . hand-holding ? not a fan . hammerhead shark ? i love that thing . yeah , it 's another fish with a tool on it head .

it 's so cute when she try .
it 's from leonard . last night be amaze . you 're amaze . i 'm so lucky to have you in my life . okay , stop it .
what 's wrong ? you look upset .
we thought my 90-year-old grandfather have revert to an asexual state , but the lawsuit from his jamaican caregiver prove u all wrong .
my point be , immortality be not only a possibility , it be real .
only if you 're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm .
if i could keep my gmail account , i 'd be okay with that .
yeah ?
that 's terrible .
oh , my god .
if we 're go to change the topic from jellyfish , i 'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle .
show a little compassion , a man die .
pchew !
you ph.d 's gon na go suck up like kripke ?
yeah , me neither . it should be about the work . and if i ca n't get tenure , i 'd like to see you or sheldon get it .
raj , do n't dangle false hope in front of leonard like that .
pchew ! pchew ! pchew ! pchew !
so tenure mean a job for life ?
yup .
you ca n't get fire even if you 're bad at it ?
mm , not really .
wow , sound a lot like be a pretty waitress at the cheesecake factory .
while i disagree with the premise of tenure , if they give it to me , it would n't diminish my output . you know , i 'm like the sun . ca n't turn this off .
be rajesh and leonard compete for it a well ?
mm-hmm .
do they know they do n't stand a chance 'cause you 're so great ?
well put . you know , i must say i go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing , but those moment when you worship me really keep you in the run .
it would be nice to have the increase income . stop take money from my parent .
i just keep think about how cool it would be if i call my mom and told her that i get tenure at caltech .
she 'd be proud , huh ?
oh , very . assume she take my call .
or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out , buy a house , get married . start a family .
or , the chainsaw .
so , who do you have to schmooze to get this deal ?
i 'm not gon na schmooze anybody . i 'm gon na let my work speak for itself .
that 's great . that show a lot of integrity .
thank you . i 'm a naive idiot , right ?
oh , good , you heard me .
you know , if you really want tenure , maybe you should cozy up to the people make the decision .
sheldon cooper do not do cozy .
you do n't say .
but i suppose it would n't hurt to know who 's on the committee . let 's see . oh , janine davis . oh , dear .
be that a problem ?
well
even you . you 're a slave .
i 'm not sure , it could go either way .
hey-hey-hey-hey-hey . mr davis .

i wo n't be able to make our date night this thursday , so , bad news for you .
well you well have a good excuse this time , because trim q-tips to fit your ear right be obvious nonsense .
first of all , when you say thing like that , people think you 're crazy . second , the reason i 'm cancel be because i have to attend a memorial service for professor tupperman .
it sound like a long and tedious even .
well , now that i think about it , that would be most helpful .
of course it would . i 'm well-versed in academic politics , and a a respect scientist , i can only raise your stock a a candidate .
actually , i meant you could drive me . but if it make you happy , that other stuff , too .
oh , not really . i be out shopping with amy . she want me to help her find something for this memorial thing .
wait , sheldon 's go to be there ? we all promise we be n't go to go .
oh , what a jerk .
i know . i be hop to go without anyone find out .
well , since amy 's go , do you want me there ? you know , to support you ?
oh , that 's nice , but it-it 's just gon na be a room full of boring old men and i 'm not sure how much help you 'd be .
okay . i 'm just gon na tie my shoe while you think about that .
oh , yeah . no . thanks , that would be great help . you realize you might kill some of them .
oh , then you all can get tenure .
okay .
sad .
the fact that there be so many people here tonight do n't make u cranky and claustrophobic . it make u ?
give mr davis the box set of root be ?
no .
fine . bad .
unbelievable . you have some nerve show up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee .
you 're here .

so be i . his passing make me feel bad .
i 'd like to know why penny 's here .
i 'm here to support my man , just like you .

yes .
well , now it 's biguous . what be you gon na do about it ?
um
you could talk some smack about his mother .
well , yes , of course , he would n't like that at all . last night , i be feel in need of sexual release when i happen to come across your mother .
okay , okay . guy , what be we do here ?
i do n't know what you 're do , but i be about to insinuate that i have coitus with raj 's mother for a dollar .
oh , you do what you want , but i do n't want to lose my friend over tenure . friend be forever .
so be tenure .
you 're right . this be beneath me . lie your mother be last night .
how about it , sheldon ?
well , you 'll always be an academic success , but i seriously question whether you 'll make any more friend .
i do n't want any more , but let 's go .
no . we can not lose to that jerk .
yeah , screw it . i 'm go in .
mr davis ? mr davis ? mr davis ? i know you 're in there . i saw your car in the parking lot .
i just found out that you recommend myself , dr hofstadter and dr koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure .
i do n't know what you mean by quirk , but , um , i do want to express my gratitude .
no , no . no , i learn my lesson . i understand that be inappropriate .
anyway , thank you .
yeah , right on , sister .
oh , dear . penny , have you be record show on our dvr again ?
no .
answer honestly . this be not a trial . that 'll come later .
absolutely not . help me out here , i ca n't afford another demerit .
yeah . uh , maybe we be hack . you know , the chinese have be hack everything lately .
i do n't know . it 's a fat guy on a segway . that 's funny everywhere .
i 'm delete it .
well , hang on . maybe the chinese have n't finish watch it yet .
you know , if you 're try to make space on the dvr , why do n't you just get rid of some of the stuff you 've already watch ? like , um , alpha .
no , that 's the season two finale . that be quite the cliffhanger . i 'm go to re-watch it before season three start .
there be no season three . they cancel that show .
well , they ca n't cancel it . it end on a cliffhanger .
they do .
uh , sheldon , there be two dumpling left . do you want them ?
dumpling ? do n't you understand what 's go on here ?
a a rule , no .
well , why do n't you make up your own end ?
ah , do n't . if they do n't want to be yell at by crazy nerd , they should n't have start a sci-fi channel .
i think you 're gon na be really happy with this security camera . the optic be great , it 's get infrared technology , and there 's even a backup battery when the power go out .
whatever . i can see my little princess while i 'm at work , right ?
why ca n't you just watch porn like a regular guy ? i need your laptop so i can configure the software .
wait , hold on . this be weird .
i be google that girl i 've be date , and i found her blog .
cool . anything juicy ?
she say she recently go on a date with a guy name roger ? and he 's indian ? and he 's an astrophysicist , too ?
you know what 's go on , do n't you ?
yes , mummy be right . american girl be sexually voracious devil .
i ca n't believe i have to explain this . people change name on blog to protect their privacy . roger be raj .
oh . i always thought , if i have a white name , it would be gavin .
keep reading . what do it say ?
no , no , i do n't know if i should . if she want me to know about her blog , she would 've told me . it 's almost like i 'm reading her diary .
it 's exactly what it 's like . keep reading .
no , this be creepy .
oh , i think we be look at creepy in the rearview mirror when i put up that camera .
it 's not creepy . do n't listen to him . oh , look who 's get the sweetest kiss .
i thought you grow up on a farm .
i be not fly back to texas just so my mom can give me a hug .
okay . well , what i think be go on here be you have a pathological need for closure .
oh , that 's nonsense . i mean , you tell me story about your day all the time . i do n't care how they end .
you know , i might be able to help you with this . there 's a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines way to retrain your neural pathway so stuff like this bother you less .
yeah , but i just told you , i do n't have a problem with closure .
oh , quite sure . that prof nothing .
ready to go to lunch ?
do you think i 'm feminine ?
yeah . let 's go .
thanks a lot .
what 's go on ?
i broke down , and i read lucy 's blog , and in one of the entry she say , when we first met , i struck her a a little feminine .
just a little ? that 's great .
i have to talk to her about this .
oh , geez , why do you girl always want to talk about thing ? listen to me , if she 's write about your relationship , use it to your advantage . rig the game .
well , that do n't seem fair .
be it fair that girl like confident , normal guy more than nervous weirdo ?
no , it 's not . i 've always thought that be unfair .
so take what 's in that blog and use it to get her pant off .
why do you have to make everything so filthy ? why could n't you just say the blog be like her give me the key to her heart ?
the key to her heart . that 's nice . be you quote someone or be it tattooed on the small of your back ?
i be quote a man who know a thing or two about woman , sir elton john .
so , do you love it ? of course you love it . how could you not love it ? tell me how much you love it .
it be cute .
oh , do n't say cute . that 's the bad .
what 's wrong with cute ?
it just make thing seem small . it diminishes them .
so you want me to stop call your little tushy cute ?
you can try , but nobody 's gon na believe you . i just , i do n't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excite by it .
i like it . i 'm excite .
well , then , tell your face .
what do you want from me ?
you know what ? never mind . we give it a shot . let 's just see what else be on .
oh , come on , do n't be like that .
well
i 'm sorry i call it cute . let 's watch another one .
really ?
yeah , it be fun . kind of remind me of my high school . but instead of vampire , we have meth head . but both come out at night and have mess up teeth .
all right , cool . i think you 'll like the next one well . all the cheerleader be suffer from an evil curse .
i 've come up with a series of exercise to help with your compulsive need for closure .
i take issue with the word compulsive .
all i 'm say be , we live in a world where closure be n't always an op
…tion . okay . for the sake of argument , let 's say i have a problem . what would be your plan for address it ?
i 'm go to recondition your brain so that the need for completion be n't so overwhelm .
by play tic-tac-toe ?
yep . your turn .
the same way any normal person would . i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldon-face confetti .
and that 's exactly the feel we want to address with this course of treatment .
come on , you can do this .
you do n't know what it 's like to feel completely frustrate . to have a desire build up within you and be deny any opportunity for release .
yeah , sound like a drag .
okay , help me out here . why do he love this show so much ?
yippee , it 's backwards . i get it .
you think ?
ugh , that sound like a lot of work .
hey , what 's up ?
uh , lucy 's come over . i need some advice .
however long you think the foreplay should be , triple it .
just tell me which one you think be more manly . this hockey jersey or this football jersey .
i do n't know . go with hockey .
good , black be more slimming . oh , that 's her . i get to go be butch . toodles . hey .
come in .
yeah , well , i would n't get too close . if i give the right command in german , she 'll rip your face off .
o'er the land of the free , and the home of the next .
that 's quite an impressive layout , be n't it ?
yes .
let 's box it up .
let 's box it up .
okay , sheldon , make a wish and blow out the candle . oops , miss one . now your wish ca n't come true .
lucky for you , 'cause i wish you be dead .
thanks . i love hockey .
not brian boitano , that 's for sure . how 's your burrito ?
probably because i do n't read the instruction . no wrapper 's go to tell me what to do . unless his name be jay-z .
i do n't know . maybe it 's all those steroid i 've be take .
wait , wait . i , i found your blog here you write about me .
you call me feminine . and i , i want you to think i be more manly .
i do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturise regimen .
yeah .
no . bought this at the staple center when i go to see taylor swift .
so , i be think how excite you get about stuff like buffy or science or which tv remote you and sheldon should buy .
the harmony one be fine . we do n't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred , which he know be too big for my hand .
see , that 's the kind of passion i do n't think i have . but then i realize i 'm passionate about you .
oh , my cute little tushy strike again .
it be , be n't it ?

look , i appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness . if i get the chance to do this , there be nothing you can say that 's go to stop me .
if you look carefully at venus , you should be able to see the international space station pas by .

okay . hey , howard , any thought on where we should get dinner ?
anywhere but the space station . on a good day , dinner be a bag full of meat loaf . but , hey , you do n't go there for the food , you go there for the view .
it 's fascinate . let me see if i can duplicate the result . howard , i 've always thought the lemon be an underrated fruit . care to weigh in ?

so , listen , sheldon , i be think , since this be gon na be our first halloween party a boyfriend and girlfriend , i thought it might be fun for u to go in a couple costume .
i could n't agree more .
really ? i find that inconsistent with everything i know about you .
r2-d and c-3po . dibs on threepio .
sheldon , when i say couple costume , i meant like romeo and juliet or cinderella and prince charm , not two robot from some silly movie i do n't even like .
okay , i 'm gon na let that slide because i know you 're hopped up on tea bag .
i make compromise for you all the time . just this once , ca n't we find something that we 're both happy with ?
fine . how about one of the most beguiling and influential couple of the 20th century ? hewlett and packard . dibs on hewlett . what ? you want to be hewlett ?
anybody home ?
hey , what be you do here ?
i just thought i 'd stop by and say hello .

it 's actually pretty neat .
yeah ?
yeah . it 's a front-projected holographic display combine with laser-based finger track . here , i 'll show you . we 'll just put this pencil over here .
sharp . thanks to the machine we saw earlier .
very good . and then a laser will map the reflective surface , and voila .
wow . that be amaze .
you know , there 's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram .
what do you mean ? . oh ! wow !
what ?
sometimes i forget how smart you be .
take off your clothes .
what ? here ? now ?
yeah . you get a problem with that ?
no , no . it 's kind of crazy . i 've never fool around in the lab before .
really ? never ?
no . i do have a shot with the lisatronic , but the extension cord be n't long enough .
before i forget , i 'd like your opinion on the menu i 've prepared for the halloween party . the theme be food that go bump in the night .
creature from the black forest ham lagoon .
on sesame seed bunzillas .
night of the living garlic bread ?
it 's funny because bread sound like dead .
i 'm sorry , but these be just ordinary food with the name bent into torture pun . the dish themselves be in no way halloweenie .
ooh , hallow-weenies ! that 's a good one . they 'll pair nicely with my draculoni and cheese . how do i do it ?
what be you smile at ?
you know where 's there 's a lot of nothing .
boy , it 's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again . do i tell you about the night my retainer float out of my mouth and into the air lock ?

i do n't talk about it every minute .
what be i suppose to talk about ? we be eat at johnny rocket .
so , i do this amaze thing and i 'm never allow to mention it ?
okay , no problem . it wo n't happen again .
i love you , too . i ca n't tell you how many time i dream i be in bed here with you when i be you know . what , i ca n't even point ?

whoa ! that 's heavy .
yeah . oh , uh , you do n't have on any jewellery , do you ?
no . why ?
whoa ! that be very cool .
sometimes i like to turn this on and pretend i 'm the super villain magneto .
get a little less cool , leonard .
but what i really be be a very smart scientist who understands the mechanic of the universe and be wear the sexy black underwear you bought him .
there we go .
so , i thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy 's tomb , or they also have the tardis from doctor who .
i do n't care . get the tardis .

i do n't see why not .
if you 're really desperate to meet woman and like have food eat out of your mouth , i could set you up with my mom .

i think i 'm hysterical .
i take it back . that be funny .
the philosopher henri bergson say it 's funny when a human be behaves like an object .
i bet that bit kill at the chuckle hut .
oh , he do n't perform stand-up comedy , he be a philosopher .
you know , i think we 're zero in on your problem .
perhaps i 'll spend some time develop a unified theory of comedy , which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time . unless they 're german , 'cause that 's a tough crowd .
be you set on people laugh with you ? ‘ cause if you 're cool with at you
i do n't get it .
really ? i never for a second thought it 'd be anything else .
if you 're so intimidate by talk to attractive girl , maybe you should practice by talk to regular people .
you mean like fatty and uggos ?
i 'm serious . go to the mall , talk to anybody , practice , that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl , it wo n't be so scary .
i 'm so proud of you .
we have n't even gotten to my scene yet .
i know , but you 're go to be a tv star and you have n't left me yet . that take gut .
i do n't know about you , but i 'm very uncomfortable with all this .
why ?
i 've never see this show before and now i 'm start with episode _ ? it 's unnatural .
just think of the first _ a the prequel .
be you kid me ?
well , the diner scene . where 's my diner scene ?
well , do n't ask me . until i see the prequel , i 'm lose .
no , there be suppose to be a big scene with me and mark harmon , but it 's go .
they must 've cut it .
oh , penny , i 'm , i 'm sorry .
that stink .
i 'm sure you be great .
this do n't make any sense . i mean , i , i thought i do a , a really good job , i excuse me .
i 've be study how to make people laugh . they say that comedy be tragedy plus time . let 's tickle some rib .
unbelievable .
oh , come on , no , that 's not what i meant .
then what do you mean ?
i think you meant that you do n't believe in me .
i want you , right now , to give me your _ % honest opinion .
right .
do you think i have what it take to really make it a an actress ?
yes .
so you think i 'll be on tv and in movie and win award .
honestly ?
yes , honestly .
i do n't .
how could you say that ?
i do n't know , i get all confuse when you say honestly .
oh .
this be interest . apparently , a key component in some form of humour be the element of surprise .
well , that make sense . the prefrontal cortex be responsible for planning and anticipation , and patient with brain lesion on their
brain lesion !
sheldon , you scar me . that be n't funny .
or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex .
okay , the notion that you can read a few book and come up with a definitive theory of comedy be absurd . i mean , humour be a complex neurological okay , that 's pretty good .
no . no pretty girl . the point be to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girl .
that depends . on any level , do you think she 's hot ?
kumquat ?
i guess .
sure .
now , would you say ointment be more , equal to , or less funny than kumquat ?
i do n't think i want to go out with you anymore .
will you please stop joking around ? i 'm try to figure this out .
sheldon , how many word be you gon na go through ?
all of them .
and you do n't get your part cut . yep , bunch of old guy rock out in a band , all with erectile dysfunction , you do n't get your part cut !
hey . can we talk ?
we can , but the part of penny might get cut .
that be really crappy of me . what you 're try to do be hard , but people do make it , and i really do believe you could be one of them .
thank you .
and to show you how much i believe in you , i kind of get you an audition .
be you serious ? for what ?
the new star war movie .
what ? how do you manage that ?
there 's this thing online , you put yourself on tape and just send it in , anyone can do it .
come on leonard , this be just a pr stunt .
so ? even if it be , you have a huge advantage because you 're an actual actress . most of the people do this be just weirdoes and nerd . wolowitz sent his in two day ago .
really , let it go .
yeah , she seem friendly and easy to never mind , she 's go . you know , maybe talk to people be too hard .
where 's sheldon ?
he 's home try to use science to determine the basis of humour .
it 's exhaust . do you have any idea how hard it be to laugh at a knock-knock joke that start with knock-knock-knock , amy , knock-knock-knock , amy , knock-knock-knock , amy ?
fake a laugh ? do you ever do that with me ?
well , i 'd be able to tell anyway .
please , i 've make plenty of girl laugh , sometimes just by ask them out . yeah ? well , i fake my orgasm .
yes , how much for a hundred long-stemmed red rose ? really ? how much for three ?
hey .
yeah , i 'll call you back .
well , i do n't think you call it idiotic .
oh . sorry , i meant to . anyway , um , i be just upset with myself . i be n't mad at you . i just feel like everything be fall apart .
come on . it 's okay .
really ? ‘ cause this morning at starbucks , a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg . and it be n't the only one in there .
okay , listen to me , this be just a minor setback .
no , it 's not , okay ? i 've be out here for , like , ten year . i 've nothing to show for it .
well , you have me .
you 're right . i do have you . mm . let 's get married .
what ?
um
do you seriously just say um ?
look , you know i love you but , but you 're , you 're drunk and sad and feel lose .
okay , so , so you do n't want to marry me ?
that be not what i say .
no , forget it . i take it back . offer 's off the table .
who 's in the mood to laugh ?
really not a good time .
but i use science to construct the perfect joke .
penny , do n't .
so , a sandwich , a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar . where be you go ?
to my room .
should i follow you ?
no .
what ?
that 's a mirror .
uh , excuse me .
ca n't sleep ?
no .
penny propose , and i do n't say yes .
why not ?
that 's a good question .
do that mean the relationship be over ?
i do n't know .
why do n't you ask her ?
because i 'm afraid to know the answer .
well , i 'm sorry .
that 's it ? you 're not gon na make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment ?
no . you 're my friend , and , i 'm sorry .
do you just put a kick me sign on my back ?
no . that would n't be funny at all .
i 'm in the middle of something .
it 's an outrage .
i know .
the university , they think they can do whatever they want . we just have to sit there and take it .
you need to let it go , sheldon .
you work tirelessly for someone , and this be what you get .
but i do n't want a vacation .
okay , listen , i do n't mean to diminish what you 're go through , but i 'm a little distract right now .
i 'm gon na go talk to penny .
i 'm go to go inside , put on my coziest pajama , curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over . penny . sorry .

i ca n't believe we waste all that time on our hulk costume .
what ? you be all go a the hulk ?
not the same hulk . ferrigno , bana , norton and ruffalo .
we would have be the angry green belle of the masquerade ball .
and we 're back to the first kind of sad .
gentleman , i have the solution to our comic-con problem . we do n't need them . i 'm start my own convention .
sheldon , just buy scalp ticket with u .
i already found a guy online who 's willing to sell .
how do you know this be n't a sting operation set up by the comic-con police ?
the same way i know that the people in the tv set ca n't see me .
sheldon , just come with u . you 're not gon na make your own convention .
i do n't even get to that part .
you do n't know that . i still have plenty of solid lead on this list .
good luck .
last week , you spent that on a little dress .
yeah , but those ticket only get him into comic-con . that dress get me into anywhere i want .
why ca n't they do something sensible like sheldon and start their own comic book convention ? also , who want to throw me out that window ?
oh . you mean like a museum ?
yes , like a museum , but anything else .
ooh , afternoon tea , how sophisticated of u .
oh , all right , if we 're gon na be fancy , i should probably put on clean underwear .
no , we 're gon na stop at target on the way .
hey , since sheldon 's not go to comic-con , maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up a .
mmm , what if we go a the fantastic four , and just tell people that the invisible girl be stand there with u .
oh , and i thought our day of pretend to be with woman who do n't exist be over .
gentleman , i be one step away from secure a huge guest for my convention .
do that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape ?
sheldon , i do n't care if you get scalp ticket with u or not , but please do n't be creepy and go stalk this poor guy . you 're gon na get in trouble .
do he sound like a criminal ?
what do you mean ?
you know , do he say thing like , youse guy , or , listen here , see ?
yes . he , he 's late because he 's on his way here from _ .
i 'm just say , we do n't know who this guy be . what if he want to steal our money or our kidney , or make a suit outof our skin ?
why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin ?
i do n't know . maybe 'cause dark do n't show the stain ?
well , now you 're make me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location .
there sure be a lot of little kid here .
well , last time i get dress up and have tea be when i be five . just me , my teddy bear , raggedy ann and my hamster .
it be . till my hamster ate all her baby . it get less cute really fast .
well , there 's a bar in the lobby .
he be , mr earl jones , he be .
i can text the guy and tell him we change our mind .
do it .
hold on . we always do this .
do what ?
chicken out . we 're , we 're so afraid of get into trouble that we never do anything wrong .
even batman break the rule .
you know i struggle with batman .

on the bright side , every six-year-old there be jealous of my tiara . not gon na lie , it felt good .
let me ask you a question , when do you guy start feel grown up ? ‘ cause i be not sure i do .
i know . one of the tennis ball come off his walker and bounce right off his head . i mean , i , i almost wet myself . i guess you have to be there .

it be . i feel alive .
yeah . what if we do get caught , who care ? so we get ban from comic-con .
maybe slap with a fine .
oh , no . i 'd be an astronaut and a bad boy , how will woman keep their pant on ?
uh , maybe it 'll come up when i apply for citizenship . oh , crap , what if it come up when i apply for citizenship ?
i wonder if we 'd have to disclose something like this when we apply for grant .

we ca n't show up to your mom 's empty-handed . we should bring something .
i already be . i 'm bring the gift of knowledge .
oh , boy .
despite what her bible say , recent archaeological study indicate that although camel be reference in the old testament , they do n't exist in the middle east until hundred of year later .
i ca n't tell you that . but perhaps the killer drop a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment .
ooh , i 'm gon na check the fridge , and see if there be any clue inside a beer .
hey , i found something . it look like a little man with a briefcase .
okay , can i ask you something ? why do you like make u do this stuff ?
well , i guess it go back to when i be a fat kid in india , and do n't have any friend .
i 've see old picture of you . you be never a fat kid .
no , i be svelte a a gazelle . a gazelle bless with a flair for storytelling .
from the future ? how fun and imaginative .
so one of u come back from the future to murder stuart ?
correct .
do the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he 's just rip off terminator ?
do the smart-ass know that terminator be actually ripped off from an outer limit script call demon with a glass hand , by harlan ellison ?
oh , do the gazelle know that accord to harlan ellison , it be not ripped off from demon with a glass hand , but be ripped off from another outer limit script he write call the soldier ?
i 'm gon na need another clue .
okay , give me the flower and pie .
but if we show up and you 're hold them , she 'll think they 're only from you .
they be only from me . you say the gift of you be enough .
nothing .
what ? sheldon , tell me what 's go on .
i saw my mommy with a naked man and she be try to be a mommy again .
you ready to talk about it ?
i 'm not nearly drunk enough . okay . do you have any idea what it 's like to see your mother ravage someone ?
do a brisket count ? i 'm sorry , buddy , that 's rough . but do n't she know we be come ?
no . i want to surprise her . what be i suppose to say to her after something like this ?
well , do she see you in the window ?
no .
then do n't say anything .
i have to . how can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if i do n't tell her how disappointed i be , and that i 'll never forgive her ?
no , i 'm just go to tell her i 'm come so she can give that good time charlie the heave-ho .
that 's some tough talk , i may need to cut you off .
yeah , maybe you well , i take a pretty big sip .
look , she 's a grown woman . and , and your dad 's be go a long time . maybe this be none of your business .
i beg to differ . i use to live in those genitals . and if someone want to move into my old room , i should at least get a vote .
fine , just try not to look too alive .
but why ?
perhaps this will help . here be some fact about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue .
hey , i won the nobel prize in physiology , then i use the money to buy stuart 's comic book store , and close it down so sheldon would pay attention to me . not the bad idea .
hey , i 'm a famous actress living in london .
hmm , i 'm a professor at stanford .
hmm .
uh , uh , uh , hang on . do you think we 'd really drift apart if we both become successful ?
of course not . if i become a famous actress and have to move , you would just come with me .
but if i get a chance to be a tenure professor , i might not have that much choice in where i end up .
yeah , but if i become a successful actress , we would n't need the money .
well , you do n't go into science for the money .
so , wait , if my career take me somewhere else , you might not go ?
dun , dun , dun . he start it .
really ? you think i 'm put this body through three kid ?

can you recommend a surface you have n't have coitus on ?
how long have you be involve with him ?
and of those few month , how long have you be a demented sex pervert ?
perhaps not . but it be a way to speak to a woman who quote the bible to me my whole life , and then desecrates one of ethan allen 's fine sofa .
or what ?
that 's ridiculous . i be a grown man . i be a professional scientist . and i currently occupy the moral high ground .
but i occupy the moral high ground .

a straight-up gore-fest ? you hate this stuff .
i do , but for some reason , emily love it and want to watch it with me tomorrow , so i thought if i start with you first , then i could act cool about it with her .
that 's actually not a bad plan . i can sit through the colonoscopy now , but that first time i be like , oh my god , a prune pit .
uh , so , you 'll watch it ?

thank you .
but to be fair , when you talk , most of what you say sound like , wah , wah , wah , clothes , wah , wah , wah .

on the bright side , she do n't even notice the pill . why do emily like this stuff ? do you think there 's something psychologically wrong with her ?

your heart might be in the right place , but your head , chest and arm certainly be n't .
anyway , the , the funeral 's on sunday .
but , that 's star war day .
yeah , um , of all the thing about this that be sad , that might not be number one . you okay ? i know he meant a lot to you .
i 'm fine .
okay . yet he cry when they change the raisin bran box .
hmm . yes . look at him , amy . it 's such a shame . struck down in the prime of my life .
do you want me to go to the funeral with you ?
oh , i 'm not go to the funeral .
all those people blowing their nose . you ca n't tell the sick from the sad . mm . i 'll be at home celebrate star war day , a plan .
be you sure you do n't want to go say good-bye ?
amy , mourn the inevitable be a complete waste of time .
and watch a bunch of goofy space movie you 've see hundred of time be n't ?
if we be in a physical relationship , you just lose sex tonight .
hey , guy .
okay .
can i make you breakfast ? admiral ackbar 's snack bar be open for business .
no , thanks . leonard and i be just go to the funeral .
you sure . not even coffee ? we have r2-decaf . maybe a nice cafe au leia ?
and if you 're not in the mood for coffee i can always make you a chai tea-3po .
oh , i get it , like c3po . what happen to me ?
hey , uh , sheldon , you want anything ?
uh , no , thank you .
you 're be so quiet . be you upset or be you just reboot ?
i 'm fine .
sweetie , be you sure you do n't want to come with u to the funeral ?
oh , i appreciate the offer , but arthur be go and there 's nothing i can do about it . when darth vader struck down obi-wan , do luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral ?
no , he blew up the death star . why do i know this ?
arthur jeffries be a scientist . i 'm sure he do n't care about silly superstition like funeral . you know , if he be here , i think he 'd say enjoy star war day .
he be _ , he 'd say where 's my pudding ?
before you go , at least let me pack you some attack of the scone for the road .
oh , like attack of the clone . we be leave right now .
arthur passing away be harder on sheldon than he 's ready to admit . really hop this will cheer him up .
no , it combine two of sheldon 's favorite thing , chocolate chip and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button .
okay , let 's get the fondant and start decorate .
i wonder why that be .
i have a confession to make .
hmm ?
i 've never be to a funeral before .
really ?
i just never knew anyone that die . i have a pet pig when i be a kid . i mean , when he die , we do n't have a funeral , we have a barbecue .
yeah , we wo n't be eat arthur tonight .
i do n't know him very well , but i still really like him . it 's weird that he 's just go .
i know .
oh that 's , that 's fine . go ahead .
sorry .
no , i 'm dry . you 're a big crybaby , you start , i 'll join in .
i be not a crybaby .
toy story _ ?
i get your back .
yeah .
okay , here we go . episode i : the phantom menace .
ugh , let 's get this over with .
since we all agree episode i be n't our favourite , maybe we just skip it this time .
howard , i think you of all people should avoid espouse the principle that if something be not our favourite we should just get rid of it .
well , you know what else be just a suggestion ? why do n't we change the raisin bran box ? hmm ? and you know who get hurt by that ? every single person who eats breakfast .
wow .
i think he 's take this professor proton thing pretty hard .
should we try to console him ?
or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief ?
by stay here and watch the movie .
that 's what good friend would do .
well , at least without sheldon here , we get to start with episode iv .
mm , true . i do feel guilty about him .
me , too .
maybe we should see how he 's do .
yeah .
but after the cantina scene .
obviously .
look at arthur , crack up at a joke i told him . i 'll never hear that laugh again .
arthur . i thought you be dead .
why be you here ?
i know why . you 've come to me because you 're my obi-wan .
you must be here to give me advice .
those be your jedi robe .
be careful with that .
so , what do you think of your first funeral ?
well , i do n't want to be a jerk , but it be kind of a bummer .
yeah , well , when i die , you can rent a bounce house .
what would you regret ?
mm , you know , that i do n't travel more , take more risk , learn another language .
you know klingon .
that 's true .
no , i meant that a a regret .
i just thought of one more .
what 's that ?
i regret not say yes when you ask me to marry you .
well , it just be n't the right time .
yeah .
and this be also not the right time . do not propose .
what ?
i know that face . that 's your propose face .
i be not gon na propose . it 's already two to one .
what 's two to one ?
i propose twice , you propose once . two to one .
oh , my . it 's not a contest .
i do n't know what you 're upset about . i 'm the one who 's lose .
okay . fine . would you feel well if i propose so you could turn me down again ?
yeah , i think i would .
no , do n't you dare . you reject me right now and tie thing up .
it 's just such a big decision . i do n't want to have any regret .
do you ever watch professor proton when you be a kid ?
i never watch him , either , but he seem to be the reason that sheldon get interested in science .
that 's cute .
oh , i guess it must have be back when i be in the girl sprout .
my mom make it up a an alternative to the girl scout . she do n't want me sell cooky on some street corner like a whore .
oh , i go to the library and take out a book on biology to see what whore do .
on the one hand , if i say yes
this be n't funny anymore . just say no so we 're do with this . will you marry me or not ?
ooh , interest . do you just propose to me again ?
no .
really ? because i just heard will you marry me ? that 's two proposal , one day . sound like someone want to spend the rest of her life tell people how to spell the name hofstadter .
you know what ? fine . do whatever you want .
hey . penny , do n't get upset . here . i love you , but , no , i will not marry you .
thank you .
now , about that second proposal . on the one hand
this be the swampland of dagobah . it 's where luke be train in the way of the jedi .
i suppose it have something to do with your recent passing .
oh , no . no . i 've already have to say good-bye to _ dr who .
of course , my grandfather die when i be five . my father die when i be _ .
and now you 're go , too . it 's like all the men i 've look up to have go away .
hey , buddy . heard you 're have a rough day . you all right ?
i 'm okay . how be the funeral ?
sheldon , that , that 'll take u all night .
that 's true . oh , it 's a good thing i have a nap .

i thought that subject have run it course , so i change it . it 's call reading the room , amy .
hey , how be thing on the set ?

so the movie 's not a bad a you thought ?
oh , no , it be , but i decide instead of complain about it , i 'm just gon na go in every day and give it my all .
good for you .
thanks . there 's no reason why i should n't be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transform into a killer gorilla anyone 's ever see .
i do n't know . the bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in schindler 's list be tough to beat .
ah , very good . because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust .
it only get funnier when you explain it , sheldon .
i know .
you mean a forklift ?
i 'm sorry . i just ca n't deal with this right now .
bernie , she 's gon na be off her foot for six to eight week . be you prepared to feed her , wash her and take her to the toilet ?
we get a nurse . preferably someone from a third world country who 's use to suffer and unpleasant smell .
not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland .
sound like a job for a love person . would you like me to play some polish music while you carry her to the toilet ?

that be awkward , right ?
uh-huh .
be it because she 's date you but be out with that other fellow ?
yes .
good . i thought she saw something on my forehead .
what give you the right to mix my dna with that of a killer gorilla ?
life ? what life ? look at me , i 'm a monster . and now i have blood on my hand , or paw . i do n't know .
i love you , too . but i 'm afraid i love kill more . like , one day , i might actually try and kill you .
actually , you know what ? can we do one more ? i think i could do it well .

oh , i 'll make english breakfast tea . they destroyed your culture . that 's close enough . you know , i 'm curious , why be you so upset about see emily with another man ?
would n't you be upset if you saw amy out with someone else ?
ca n't happen . we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me .
slick , huh ?
to be truthful , emily and i have n't date that long , and we never agree to be exclusive to each other .
have you have intercourse ?
no .
well , stick to your gun . there will be a lot of pressure .

well , what if we use our vacation time ?
i do n't know what else we can do .
hi , mom . i have some excite news .
before i tell you , will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concern you have to yourself ?

you know what ? it 's probably fine .
i 'm your son . what about the fact that she 's good enough for me ?
thanks , mom .
yes , it would .
shut up .
you want some wine ?
i think leonard 's mom 's okay with me .
so , what be the living arrangement gon na be ?
well , have n't really talk about it yet , but i figure at some point , i 'll move in with him , or he 'll move in with me .
well , with you not work , that make financial sense .
not a chance .
no .
okay , then , yeah .
no , keep your money .
what you work on ?

oh . how 's it go ?
you 're right . i 'll take that out .
mm .
now that penny and i be engage , i thought we might want to talk about our living arrangement .
of course . she 's spent many night here , and you 're worried about preserve the myth of her virginity before the wedding .
i 'm not .
good , because not only have that ship sail , if it hit an iceberg , countless men would perish .
actually , this be about where she and i be go to live .
what do you mean ?
i do n't understand . how could we all live together if i 'm not there ?
look , i , i know this be , this be change , and that sound scary .
where be you go to go ?
i do n't know . we just start to think about this . maybe i 'll move in with penny , or maybe she and i 'll take this place , and you can move across the hall .
move across the hall ? do you take a marijuana ?
no , i do not .
do you get hit on the head with a coconut ?
no .
well , then , i 'm all out of guess . what ? me move across the hall . why would you even suggest such a thing ?
because i love penny , and want to give her the life she deserves .
i see . you 're put your future bride 's happiness above mine .
well , yeah .
wow .
how dare the university force me to go back to string theory ?
they just do n't appreciate you .

i have real problem here , amy . i ca n't be mollify with a beverage design for child . mmm , yummy .
you know , this might work out for the best . i mean , you 're always complain about what a terrible roommate leonard be . like how he turn up the thermostat when you 're not there .

leonard , we ca n't protect him forever .
i know , but
he 'll be okay . you taught him well , padawan .

yeah , anything be well than this .
hello .
i be wrong . this be bad .
wait , wait , if it be n't for indiana jones , the ark would never have end up at the warehouse .
that 's true . he collect and deliver the ark to the proper authority for filing .
like a hero .
although , technically , indy be suppose to take the ark to a museum to be study . he could n't even get that do .
awkward silence , sheldon on his phone , no touch . somebody 's have date night .
it 's actually steamier than it look . sheldon 's look up the phallic symbolism of root vegetable in renaissance painting .
oh , no , i get bore with that . i 'm just browsing cuticle scissors on amazon .
how do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table ?
if you do that , i 'll scream .
sheldon , i have some excite news to tell you .
that make two of u . my new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business day . come on , one .
i 've be invite to consult on an experiment at your university for a few month . be n't that great ? we could have lunch together . we could carpool .
you know , rid with leonard have gotten a little tedious lately . the only car game he ever want to play be the quiet game . and he 's terrible at it , i always win .
so , you 're okay with this ?
well , why would n't i be ?
well , this project would have u work in close proximity to one another . and there 's the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats .
really ?
yes .
i 'm relieve that you do n't have a problem with u work together .
not a relieve a i 'm about to be . it 's a brave new world , little lady .
be you crazy ? you do n't want your girlfriend at work with you . hell clam .
why not ? hairy fairy .
i think it could be romantic . you know , my parent met at his place of work .
your father 's a gynaecologist .
no , no , i think it 'll be great . maybe next time he get conjunctivitis at work , she can hold his head and try to put the drop in his eye . giant baby .
that 's a rag ogre .
yeah , i know .
i 'm just say , i 'd never want to work with bernadette . can you imagine see someone all day long and then you 're suppose to hang out with them after work , too ?
hold on . we do that all the time . you and i work together and play together .
well , i appreciate your concern , but i wo n't be see any more of amy than i already do . i assume we 'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota .
please let me be there when you tell her that .
please , oh , please , just let me be there .
i 'm lead a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme lead to paralyze fear in monkey .
wait , you 've , you 've do this experiment on human ?
you know , not a lot of people know this , but the monoamine oxidase enzyme be discover by a woman , mary bernheim . that 's right , my phone be just a smart a you guy .
amy , bernadette , penny . amy , bernadette , penny . amy , bernadette , penny .
i do n't mind . i 'm hop to put his love of repetition to good use someday .
hi . um , i 've reconsider . uh , you ca n't work where i work . enjoy the rest of your even .
sheldon . i already sign the contract . i cashed a cheque .
mmm , you be not go to come out of this look good .
well , i be . but that be before howard explain to me how awful it would be if he have to work with his significant other .
now , do n't be insult . he just think too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious .
yeah , well , now , well , keep it short . from what i gather , brevity be your friend . so , be we good here ?
no , we 're not good here . i be work on this project .
yeah , and you ca n't tell her what she can and can not do .
last week , you told leonard he could n't wear his wookie jacket out in public .
that 's different . i 'm not go to the mall with someone dress like a dumb space bear .
sheldon , you do n't have to worry about me bother you . i 'll be in a different building . and we do n't even have to have lunch together .
yes . before all thing , i 'm a scientist . i 'm just there to do my work and , with a little luck , scare the living crap out of some monkey .
hmm . you sure your mothlike personality wo n't be drawn to this blazing fire that be myself ?
more and more sure .
well , then , you have my permission .
i do n't ask for your permission .
too late . no backsies .
no , no , listen to me . sheldon misunderstood . what i meant be , if we work together , there 'd be too much of me for you , not the other way around .
howard , if you 're go to lie to your wife , do n't start the sentence with sheldon misunderstood . that 's a dead giveaway .
okay , fine . i do say that , and i think it 's true . i think if we work together and live together , we 'd get sick of each other .
yeah , but to be fair , he only say the part about him get sick of you .
for the love of god , why ?
his only option here be to fake a heart attack or have a real one .
it 's nothing in particular . i
my arm be feel numb .

what be you talk about ?
this table , it 's in square centimetre . i read it a square metre . you know what that mean ?
that american ca n't handle the metric system ?
amy , i be off by a factor of _ .
but the chinese team found the element .
yeah , well , they should n't have . my calculation be wrong . there must be some resonance between the element i do n't know about .
so you just get lucky ?
sheldon cooper do not get lucky .
you and me both , brother . it do n't matter . the element be found because of you , and that 's groundbreaking .
what matter be the great scientific achievement of my life be base on a blunder . i 'm not a genius , i 'm a fraud .

oh , that 's right . nacho and a turkey club .
not even close .
you want to say sorry .
what do you mean how ? what 's the big deal ?
you told lucy he be a pathetic mess .
okay , you guy be overreact . raj be gon na appreciate how i have his back .
i 'm think about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotate mirror turn virtual photon into real one a a method of observe dark energy .
that 's a pretty cool idea .
yeah . it 's great you 're here . i 'd love to get an engineer 's opinion .
sure .
this chair be squeaky . now , do i fix it or get a new one ?
hey , that next of kin thing sound pretty good .

can i ask you guy a question ? so , i 'm see lucy tomorrow night , and i 've never hung out with someone who broke up with me . how do you do it ?
you ca n't let her know you 're hurt . you know , the key be confidence .
why be the key always confidence ? how come it 's never love handle and flop sweat ?
well , can i say she look nice ?

oh , my god ! be that sweater make of bee ? come on , take it off . i wo n't tell .
so you can send it to princeton and get your money back .
i must say , sheldon , you 're handle this dvd business with an impressive amount of maturity .
i do n't know why that surprise you . i 'm a grown man . a should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel .
be there some kind of new cop mechanism you 're employ ?
the more interest question you should be ask be , what do this flower smell like ?
there 's nothing to tell . maybe i purchase a book entitle do n't sweat the small stuff and i follow it wise suggestion , one of which be stop and smell the flower .
seriously ?
please . ha-ha , oh .
hello . oh , it 's so good to see you .
well , and i ate all the crumb cake . we both make mistake .
i think i know the answer to this , but just to be clear , it 's not me , right ?
this be all your fault , i should 've listen to mun-mun because i 've be play with a cobra and her name be penny . why be you so cruel ? do you enjoy my pain ?
there 's a girl at the cheesecake factory i can set you up with .
i love you , penny .
how be it i can conceptualize a methodology of examine dark matter in the universe but ca n't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower ?
i think the real question be , why do you waste your time with cheap , childish prank ?
there 's probably a deep reason . which i 'd be happy to discus with you over some peanut brittle in a can .
okay , sheldon , i be out of option . video store owner , nursis manookian , have no next of kin .
well , you seem hot under the collar , or be that the sweater ?
listen to me , sheldon . i be not go to lebanon to return super mario brother the movie .
you know , it might be fun . you love hummus .
why be n't this bother you ? be n't your brain get itchy ? this be on your card . this could be ruin your credit score . why be n't this make you crazy ?
leonard , i have something to tell you , but i want you to promise not to flip out .
what ?
what ?
i be go to mention it at the time , but then i thought , some day , this might be a teachable moment .
aaaah ! i , you , how can , what !
sheldon , that be diabolical .
i know . and it be n't easy . do you have any idea what it 's like to wait for year and never know if you 're go to finally get satisfaction ?
i do n't believe you , you 're lie to me .
oh , it 's okay . i have no moral and i 'm desperately lonely . i 'll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side .
what be wrong with you ?
what be wrong with you ?
the math be all there . it 's not real .
yes , it be .
yeah , uh , look , it be scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow . even you , with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulder , you could n't do it .
oh , stop it . i 've see you eat , like , a million hamburger .
hey , an animal can be both sacred and delicious .
look , i 'm tell you i 've do it , okay ? i clearly remember the cow stand up and then the cow on it side .
be you drunk ?
i be _ in nebraska . what do you think ?

it would n't kill you to pick up the phone .

amy , may i please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate ?
we 're in a move car . what do you expect me to do ? stick my finger in my ear ?
oh , of course it 's no big deal to you . you idolize me , and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on .

well , i do n't say i be your father .
do n't talk to her like that . that be my mother . wife . my wife . i say my wife .
yeah , in my house .
but you still accomplish something .
yeah . if you have told anyone that you be go away on a train by yourself across the country , do you know what they would have say ?
that i could n't do it ?
exactly . right after they say yeah .
but you do do it . so what if it do n't all go your way ? that 's what make it an adventure .
indeed . i be the world 's smartest caterpillar . and then after pupate in our nation 's railway system , i 've burst forth a the world 's smartest butterfly .
butterfly could 've gotten himself home from arizona .
yeah , i feel renew . i 'm ready to deal with any change that come my way .
hey , look who 's back .

and you thought they all have a silver line .
i know . you know , i almost die in a fire in de moines , but i stayed put . fyi , that 's when the imodium give out .
but the truth be i can no longer balance a full-time career , a popular internet show , and a girlfriend .
and he really do have one , you jerk on the comment board .
so a they say , all good thing must come to an end .
after only _ episode .
_ if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on .
you say you be n't gon na bring that up .
it be so good .
you know , i thought cleaning out a dead professor 's office be gon na just be boring , but then i found his denture and realize it 's also gross .
do n't professor abbott 's family want any of this stuff ?
i do n't think he have a family .
that 's rough .
i know . you can spend your whole life work , and at the end all that 's left be some paper in a box .
make you think . oh , well .
hey . hey , we 're suppose to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it 's important .
i do . it 's all outdated or disprove .
i do n't know . this old pen kind of prof gravity . when i tilt it , her bathing suit fall right off .
oh , my dad use to have a pen like that . i date it all through sixth grade .
it still feel weird just throw away his work like this .
do n't feel bad . someday someone will be throw out your work , too .
poor roger abbott .
roger abbott sound just like roger rabbit .
oh , dan . my bos who do n't want to hire me and now 's a little hug machine .
i 'll be right there . bernadette 's just parking the car .
come on . she 's not that bad .
i know she can be a little intense , but , i swear , she be so sweet once you get past all the
oh . we be just talk about how much we love work with you . be n't that right ? dan ?
and , yes , even shed a tear or two .
like when you do a two-hour fourth of july spectacular and it do n't get record .
how many time do i have to say i 'm sorry ?
how about four thousand . one for every domino i set up to make that american flag . please enjoy these highlight .
crikey , what flag do we have today ?
australia , mate .
and now it 's time for the speed round of flag or not a flag .
say , betsy ross , what you work on ?
i have no idea . because the story of me sew the first american flag be unsupported poppycock .
then who do sew it , hmm ?
do n't ask me . i 'm just a simple seamstress whose descendant be out to make a quick buck .
fancy a dip , my dear ?
i do .
wait , that purple flag indicates that marine pest , such a jellyfish , be present .
no . this be . stop look at my leg .
when stuff like this get me down , you know what i like to do ?
sing hakuna matata like an eight-year-old girl ?
wrong , smarty-pants . it 's everything be awesome from the lego movie .
look at these notebook . they 're full of page and page of data . he clearly spent year on this .
mmm . it 's just column of random number . toss it .
well , but what if this be a potential breakthrough for him ? what if , what if this be the thing that would 've finally let him open that bottle of champagne ?
maybe he do n't know what to pair champagne with . strawberry , caviar , oyster . all good choice . yeah , that look right there be why people eat before they come to your party .
this have to mean something .
well , there 's no discernible pattern that i can see , but it should n't be too hard to run the number and check .
well , maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer .
sure . we could try multiple regression with vary physical and experimental constant .
oh , we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physic problem .
ooh , it might be a substitution cipher . we could start with basic cryptanalysis .
or we could talk to this guy he use to share an office with .
oh , let 's do that .
because you do n't know how to do cryptanalysis , do you ?
so , dan , you have a grandson . how old be he ?
i heard he be be picked on by a mean kid .
oh , i do n't know . maybe he do n't like the fact that you call his grandson a wuss .
okay , look , i know what a good person you be , but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh .
action .
welcome back . our guest today be a return fan favourite . he put the reading in your rainbow , the geordi in your la forge , and the kunta in your kinte , mr levar burton .
you do this , i delete your contact information .
while you watch me do it .
you heard him , leonard . no , it 's not racist .
be we sure this be the place ?
the doorman say this be the right building .
i think if you 're pull up your pant , you 're not a doorman .
uh , i 've be look for a professor sharpe ?
hi . we 're from the university . we 're try to get some information about professor abbott .
we be cleaning out his office and found these book full of number .
any chance you know what it be ?
really ?
do it work ?
well , he could have be hit by a bus . you do n't know .
so , be there anything that professor abbott work on during his life that come close to an accomplishment ?
well , you could be very frugal . i 'm get a little tire of everybody 's sarcasm .
yeah , you do . i felt so self-conscious , i have to return them .
you 're do it again .
oh , come on , they do n't hate you , all right ? they 're just a little intimidate . all you need to do be show everyone how sweet you really be .
even though your dress be ugly .
if you do n't press record
i press it .
well , that 's it . that 's the end of roger abbott .
and we still do n't know who frame him .
i guess the sad truth be , not everyone will accomplish something great . some of u may just have to find meaning in the little moment that make up life .
that 's a nice way of look at it .
yeah for you , not for me . i go to space . i 'm cover .
yeah , me , too .
then , of course , rub our success in sheldon 's face .
oh , well , that 's the best part .
oh , yeah .

you guy suck .
you know the best part of work in the clean room ? no allergy . check it out . oh , that , that , that 's a lot of oxygen .
we should get go to amy 's .
can you believe there be a time when we would have need an array of giant cherenkov telescope to detect cosmic particle ? and here we be building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses .
i know . if we be still single , we 'd be trip over all that booty .
you shut the load door , right ?
i thought you do .
do you know what a disaster this be ?
you mean 'cause this room be n't suppose to have dust in it , and we just let in a fly crap machine ?
what do we do ? should we call someone ?
and tell them that we compromise all the equipment ? let 's just get it out of here before anyone know .
okay , how do we catch it ?
well , what if we turn off all the light except for one , and it 'll come to it .
it 's not a moth .
okay , so if i remain calm , i 'll get more gem like turn off the light ?
great , we 're turn on each other . that 's just what the bird want u to do .
so , dr koothrappali , long flight ?
oh , that 's rough .

my uncle be accuse of that , too . it turn out to be legal in oklahoma .
oh , we 're not exchange gift .

hmm . it 'd have to be something heinous , something that make her a miserable a she 's make me . oh , i 've get it . this be good .
i 'm go to buy her a present .
with gift-giving , there 's an imply social contract . if i show up tonight with a present , and she do n't have one for me , she 'll feel terrible .
yes . maybe she 'll feel so guilty , she 'll never make me celebrate the holiday again .
that 's right . so stay on my good side , or i 'll get you a little something , too .
okay , here 's the plan . i 'm gon na put the food in the bag , and when he land in the bag to eat it , we close it up .
a slim jim ?
it 's all i could find . it 'll work .
sure . if the pigeon 's stone or a trucker .
okay , well , what 's your plan ?
i told you my plan . let 's call building service and get help .
and admit that we contaminate the clean room ?
no , admit that you contaminate the clean room .
why do you keep assume it be me ?
because you do this kind of thing all the time , and then you try to cover it up .
like when ?
what about when you flip the mar rover , or lose koothrappali 's dog , or almost drove off with that baby ?
again , it look like my car , and the baby do n't even cry until his mother punch me with her key .
fine , put the slim jim in the garbage bag .
well , what if you say it without sound so condescend ?
i can try , but your plan have the word garbage bag and slim jim in it .
hey , what 's go on ?
oh . genius here want to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a slim jim .
should have put it in the bag first .
so , if you do n't mind me ask , do you think you might start date again ?

i might argue a hanukkah miracle , but i 'll take it . come on , little guy , let 's get you outside . get the curtain .
someone should really close that load door .
well , that 's that . the room 's compromise . they 'll have to change all the filter , probably shut it down for week .
you be right . go ahead , call building service . tell them it be my fault .

yeah , today amy and i be decide what we 're all gon na do .
you get it , you girl be in charge .

i actually ca n't . my hip do n't open wider than _ degree . i rode a very thin pony once . on the first bump , just popped right off .
all right , well , what do you want to do ?
there 's a craft and folk art museum on wilshire .

i do not force you to go to that .
you walk out of the house in a fez and bow tie . i go so you do n't get beat up .
i be n't gon na get beat up .
you be , but somehow i held myself back .
you know what you could make u do ? ice-skating . the cold air will trigger leonard 's asthma and it play right into my well-known fear of get flatten by a zamboni .
now you 're help them find way to make u miserable ?
well , i 'm sorry , leonard , i 'm a problem-solver , it 's what i do .
i actually ca n't go ice-skating . i have unnaturally brittle ankle .
be there any part of your body that 's normal ?
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god .
will you please relax ?
i ca n't take it , dude .
no , i 'm not okay . i feel like i 'm gon na jump out of my skin .
i 'm worried about the new horizon space probe .
nine year ago he be part of a team that launch a spacecraft to collect data about pluto , and it 's finally close enough , so this morning it turn itself on .
we hope . the signal have to travel over three billion mile . so it 's gon na be hour before we know if it even survive .
now we get to see him flip out because he 's worried it be demolish by space ice .
space ice be no joke . i ca n't even watch frozen anymore .
ooh , the philharmonic be play beethoven downtown .
before you say yes , it 's not the movie about the big dog .
how come we ca n't think of something we both want to do ?
because you always pick what we do and i just go along with it .
ah , interest , we 're be accuse of make you do thing you do n't like , and here you be , do the same thing to poor amy .
you should point out the hypocrisy of that .
that 's what i be do .
oh , that be n't clear . try it again , but this time drive it home with how do you like them apple , missy ?
all right , keep think .
well , then , it 's settle ?
what do you say ? sound kind of perfect .
well , once again , it 's what i do .
i know . i get it . when i be in the soyuz capsule return from the space station , plummet toward earth at _ mile per hour
before you finish , be this a story about patience and wait or just another reminder that you go to space ?
ugh , i feel like i 'm gon na have a heart attack .
you work in pharmaceutical , do n't you have anything you can give him ?
i ca n't stop think about it .
i know .
maybe you need to do something more productive .
okay . if i make this shot in the trash can , the probe will have arrive in perfect work order .
so , in addition to be crazy , you 're rest the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess .
yes .
the man who crashed his stationary bike .
i do n't crash it , okay ? my playlist be too up-tempo , i get light-headed and i fell off . okay . it all come down to this .
you happy ? now you can relax .
what kind of scientist be you ? everyone know you get to make two out of three .
this be n't so bad .
you guy comfy ? this might take a while .
i do n't understand why woman insist on make a big production out of buying clothes .
no , you 're right , we should do what you do . have our mom send u pant from the walmart in houston .
they have a man there who understands my personal style .
bye .
uh , i 've get some bad news . there 's no cell service in here .
oh . well , that 's all right . there be plenty of way to pas the time before smart phone be invent .
that 's true .
i 'll look them up . son of a biscuit .
sheldon , it 's fine .
no , it 's not fine . what kind of store in the 21st century do n't at least have wi-fi ? i 'm go to call their corporate office . son of a biscuit .
let 's see , my army be go to attack the shire from buckland . and i roll a five and a three .
okay . and to defend , i roll two six . i win .
boy , double-sixes again . you know , if i have n't see it with my own eye , i would n't believe it . i wonder how long we 're gon na be stuck here .
i do n't know , but the girl do a lot for u . it 's the least we can do .
oh , that 's true . i suppose it 's only fair we make compromise .
look at you , be all mature .
i do n't know why you 're so surprised . if there 's one thing i know about after living with you for so many year , it 's how to compromise .
all the time .
on earth ? in our life ? that , that , that we 're living ?
what ? then . then why do n't you do it ?
if it 's okay with you , i 'd like to go to temple .
buddy , trust me , you do n't want to convert to judaism . i mean , i know i make it look cool , but it 's not all brisket and dreidels .
i meant a hindu temple .
oh . okay . it 's not like indiana jones and the temple of doom , right ? some bald guy with horn be n't gon na rip my heart out .
dude , that movie 's an imperialist fantasy that make the follower of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarian .
you love that movie .
yeah , it 's pretty great .
i 'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious .
why ?
yeah , but you 're a scientist .
so ?
so , a a scientist , you believe the way to understand the universe be through fact and evidence , and now you 're counting on some blue chick with a hundred arm to help you ?
that be so offensive . do everything you know about hinduism come from indiana jones ?
actually there 's no proof of that .
you believe in your religion , i 'll believe in mine .
how 's it go in there ?
uh , not really a great outfit for work , unless something open up in the hooker and whore division . hey , can i ask you something ?
sure .
do i really force you to do thing you do n't want to ?
yeah , but it 's okay .
how be it okay ?
i promise myself , if i ever get friend , i 'd do whatever they say . really , i 'm lucky you found me before a cult do .
absolutely . you name it , we 're do it .
basket weave at the craft museum .
well , you name it .
i be n't do , but go ahead . he say , compromise .
because of you , i 'm not allow to adjust the temperature in my own home . i 'm not allow to whistle . i do n't wear shoe that might squeak .
well , you 're a physicist , not a circus clown .
sheldon , do you realize i do n't live with the woman i love because of you ? no other reason . just you .
be that true ?
yes , it 's true . the last time i brought it up , you have an emotional breakdown and get on a train and ran away .
you have no idea how much you inconvenience the life of everyone around you . it 's exhaust .
well , i 'm sorry , too . and if you want to live with penny , then i think you should .
do you mean that ?
yes . yeah , just put on your squeaky shoe and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life .
come on , do n't get upset .
i 'm not upset . i 'm just imagine a world without my best friend in it .
sheldon .
it 's okay .
i understand . either way , i want you to know that i 'm aware of how difficult i can be . so i just want to say thank you for put up with me .
buddy .
how be you guy get along ? what ? why be there tear ?
everything 's fine . we just start talk about living arrangement .
be you crazy ? you know he 's a flight risk .
that 's exactly what i told him .
sheldon , we know this be a sensitive subject , and leonard 's not gon na move out until you 're ready .
well , what if you do it gradually ?
all right . how about we start with two night a week i live with penny ?
how about one night and i let you whistle ?
okay .
when i 'm not home .
you get it .
there we go , compromise again . we really be the best .
here we go , my first hindu temple .
you see behind the fountain , that tower that look like a pyramid ? it 's call a sikhara . it symbolizes the , the connection between the human and the divine .
huh . i always thought it be mini golf .
all right . shall we ?
yeah . just , uh , be there anything i should know before i go in ?
like what ?
like be i dress okay ?
really ? so every other place you 've be , you thought this be fine ?
you saw her . she look like jim carrey from dumb and dumber .
raj , you just get a text . the probe turn on . it 's fine .
oh , good . namaste , grandpa .
i thought this be gon na be boring , but it 's actually kind of fun .
do n't tell amy that . we 'll be here every sunday .
sheldon , that really be an excellent basket .
it 's not a basket . it 's a soldier 's helmet from 16th century china .
very nice .
yeah , it look great .
i saw that .
well , roomie , it 's only one night a week , but it 's a start .
i know . i 'm really proud of sheldon .
yeah , i 'm proud of him , too .
can you keep it down ? some of u be try to sleep out here .
before you leave , could you test these noise-cancelling headphone ?
yeah , sure .
okay . go ahead .
uh , bernadette 's nickname for you be the virgin pina colada .
your george lucas autograph be really a me autograph .
yeah , once i be too lazy to walk across the hall , so i use your toothbrush .
ooh , and one time when you be asleep , amy totally take off her and that 's why you 're the best roommate ever .
aw , now i 'm sad i do n't hear it .
so what do you need the headphone for ?
i do n't want to talk about it . there , the place be all yours .
yeah , have fun .
oh , i will , nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting even of science .
bye .
okay . here we go . proton decay . proton decay . proton decay . proton decay . proton decay . proton decay .
hey , we 're home . any progress ?
what be you do ? it 's time to go .
i 'm not go to work today . and would you like to know why ?
call me if you need anything .
i 've be cooped up in here too long . maybe i need some fresh air .
ugh ! ugh ! ugh ! ugh !
penny ?
ugh !
penny ?
ugh !
penny ?
ugh , what ?
you sound in distress . i be worried something unpleasant be happen to you . like a murder . or spontaneous coitus with leonard .
oh , i 'm just do this awful workout . i hate it .
well , if you hate it , then why be you do it ? although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard .
i do n't know , i guess i like that i hate it . it make me work harder .
and to clarify ?
the exercise , sheldon . should n't you be get ready for work ?
i 'm not go . would you like to know why ?
uh , you 're sad about not get anything do last night , so you 're gon na sit around and pout about it ?
boy , i 'm not nearly a mysterious a i think i be .
i invent a game . you want to play ?
sure .
it 's call emily or cinnamon . i give you actual quote i 've heard raj say , and you guess if he be talk to his girlfriend or his dog .
go ahead , make fun . you ca n't embarrass me , i 've get a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who love me so much she drink my bathwater .
okay , who be he talk to , emily or cinnamon ? i want you to know , the bed feel so lonely when you 're not in it .
i may not be like this game so much .
cinnamon . give me another one .
okay , emily or cinnamon ? check it out , i get u match sweater .
we all get the christmas card , cinnamon .
you know , a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet . it 's not strange .
well , i suppose
okay , we 'll do it .
do .
_ second . okay , that 'll be our baseline .
you know , i do n't want to tell you how to do your job , but when a mouse completes a maze , it get a food pellet .
it also get it brain plucked out with tweezer .
and his last meal be a food pellet ? you 're a monster .
all right , next , we 're gon na introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus , measure your stress level and see how it affect your problem-solving rate .
very well . and good luck , i 'm a pretty laid-back guy .
i 'm sorry , i be aim for your heart .
my mother say that 's how good girl do it .
perhaps this be a waste of time .
sheldon , you 're a remarkable scientist . just be patient , i 'm sure you 'll find the breakthrough you 've be look for .
thank you .
and if you only do solid research instead of make a groundbreaking discovery , what do it matter ?
only do solid research ? i come to you for help , and you insult me ? i thought the least that you would do would be
look , your anxiety level be right in the zone .
really ? oh , that 's fantastic . now , wait , they 're drop . why be they drop ?
because you 're happy they 're elevate .
oh , that be infuriate . ooh , look , they go back up again . terrific . oh , no , they go back down .
all right , guy , what game do you want to play ?
let 's see . how about emily or cinnamon ?
you know what ? i think it 's a little weird that you remember me say all these thing . maybe the truth be , you 're jealous of all my relationship .
oh , maybe i be . who would n't want to be the girl , or possibly dog , to hear the word you 're so lucky , you have the shiniest hair .
that be a tough one . uh , i know he brush both of them .
yes .
yes .
well , i do n't think that 's gon na help at all .
oh , no , it will . see , by keep my mind engage , i 'll become more focus .
howard 's right , that 'll never work .
stop fight me on the premise . it 's scientifically valid . i 'm go to advance proposition , i just want you to challenge me .
i do n't think that 's what you want at all .
why , of course it 's what i want . why would i say it 's what i want if it 's not what i want ?
because it be what you want , and it 's not what you say .
yes , we can .
yeah , well , then do it .
nah .
you guy be the bad . thank you , i think that be helpful .
so , whichever rep have the best sale for the quarter get a trip for two to hawaii .
yeah , clearly you have n't see him on the beach walk around with his metal detector .
if i be go to hawaii , i 'd spend all my time at the keck observatory . do you know that the telescope there have well resolution than the hubble ?
really ? want to go to hawaii ?
lady ? lady ? lady ?
come in .
lady .
what 's up ?
well , a you may know , i 've be experiment with elevate anxiety level , and i thought , what well way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an even of tasteless uncensored crotch talk ?
what exactly do you think go on here ?
and how difficult it be to do when she 's bloat , cranky and crampy ? continue .
sheldon , we be just people . we talk about the same thing you guy talk about .
you talk about if werewolf can swim ? see , leonard say yes , but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he be bitten . what do you think ?
let 's just talk about our period .
no , hold on . all canine instinctively know how to swim . why would n't a werewolf have the same ability ?
boy , taylor be right , hater gon na hate , hate , hate , hate , hate .
you 've be work so much lately , i 'm glad you do n't forget about date night .
sheldon .
yeah .
maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me .
i can do both . my brain be work at optimal capacity . i can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time .
sheldon . sheldon , i 'm worried about you . you 're not eat , you have n't slept in day , and , to be honest , that cap be start to smell .
okay , so it 's one vote emily , one vote cinnamon . penny , you 're the tiebreaker .
say the quote again .
it 's just so perfect that we 're both libra .
wow , this be hard . i 'm gon na say cinnamon .
yes .
yes .
come on .
that be the last one , i promise . we wo n't play any more .
thank you . ‘ cause if she ever found out , it would hurt her feeling .
yes , emily . whatever . where 's sheldon ?
date night .
he chase a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car .
you do n't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment .
he be get a lot of work do . he have a pretty interest take on proton decay .
wow , if he crack that it 's a game changer , guy . it 'll completely redefine our understand of the physical universe .
hmm , it would . okay , back to emily or cinnamon ? how can such a little girl eat such a big steak ?
sheldon , i want you to take that cap off .
that nag tone be help my anxiety , yeah . but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill , that 'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah .
i 'm sorry , but you know we agree not to bring work to date night .
there you go , perfect .
sheldon , stop it , i 'm not kid . take the cap off , and put the notebook away .
but after month of struggle , i 'm finally make progress .
you do n't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive .
that 's not true .
yeah , well , maybe it be , maybe it be n't . i have be hallucinate lately .
sheldon , this have to stop . you need to get some sleep and take care of yourself .
amy , i have gotten more do in the last few day than i have since i make the switch to dark matter . what if i stop do this , and it all go away ?
your thought and idea come from you , not from your anxiety .
hmm , perhaps . but i 'm not take the cap off .
it 's one thing to make yourself miserable , but you 're make everyone around you miserable , too . now , i 'm tell you for the last time , take the cap off .
oh , really ? what if i do n't ? and before you answer that , can i have my dessert ?
and then she threw me out . me , her very own boyfriend . when all i 've do be try to help humanity reach of the world we live in .
i knew you 'd understand , armadillo isaac newton .
okay .
hey . what be you try to pull ? the president of science be n't in here .
you lie down , he 'll be here in a minute .
okay . hey , i thought you be try to trick me .
now , you just get comfortable .
yeah , you get some sleep .
no , i do n't want to go to sleep , you ca n't make me .
you 're right , we ca n't .
soft kitty , warm kitty .
little ball of fur .
you know , he can be a lot of trouble , but when i see him lie here asleep like this , i just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face .
mmmm .
you look like you get some rest .
i turn on the heat in my car and some vomit come out , so my level , right up there .
hey , guy . mind if emily join u for lunch ?
yeah , sure .
yeah , no problem .
of course not .
well , um , we be just kid around .
wow , you remember that ?
yeah , i listen to what you say . you 're building a particle detector use superfluid helium .
you know , when you talk like that , i want to take you right here on this table .
and you know from past experience this table can not support both our weight . so , how 's the detector go ?
well , it 's tricky work with superfluids . whatever container you put them in , they kind of creep up the side and crawl out all on their own .
kind of like sheldon 's ant farm .
okay , well , this be cool . uh , there 's a thing call superfluid vacuum theory , where empty space be imagine a a superfluid with all of it quality , viscosity , density , surface tension
hey , if you 're pause for dramatic effect , i 'd keep it move .
which mean a spherical multidimensional superfluid show the same negative-energy density a space-time . so what do you think ? what do you think ? so what do you think ?
hmm .
hmm .
i know this be n't my area , and i could never do the math like you can , but could this be something ?
well , you could have set newton 's gravitational constant to one . and , ugh , the whole thing reek of blueberry . you know i ca n't stand these scent marker .
no one told you to taste them . come on , be , be this good or not ?
it 's good .
really ?
i like it . i think you 're on to something .
you do ? you 're not mess with me ?
you 're give me a sticker ?
not just a sticker . that be a sticker of a kitty say me-wow .
i 'm not a preschooler .
fine , i 'll take it back .
i earn this . back off .
you 're still awake ?
for a man whose last observation be our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid , you 're still awake seem like quite the sophomore slump .
you work out all the math .
oh , i do more than work out all the math . i write a paper .
you write a paper on my idea ?
when do my idea become our idea ?
when i mixed it with sheldony goodness and cooked it in the easy-bake oven of my mind .
this be good . our idea be really good .
well , the lightbulb in this oven be ridiculously bright .
you know , if no one 's thought of this , yet , this could be a big deal .
only way we 'll know for sure be if we post it online to the pre-print server . i have it ready to go , but i be n't gon na do it without you .
wow , it 's all happen so fast . should we just sleep on it ?
we could , but we always run the risk of someone else beating u to the punch .
you 're sure it 's good ?
my name be right on there with yours . that be a surefire mark of quality . that might a well say direct by joss whedon .
okay , partner , let 's do it .
come on . click the mouse with me .
one , two three .
well , we do it .
yes , we do , my friend .
be your tongue blue ?
i do n't want to talk about it .
whatever happen to that ape movie you be in ?
oh , god . probably nothing . i think i saw the director twirl a sign outside the verizon store .
what , no , why ?
it would be humiliate .
they have it .
please ?
have you even see it ?
no .
sheldon , this be superfluid helium . put this in your mouth , your tongue will freeze and break off .
do it smell like blueberry ?
no .
then we 're probably okay .
hey , your paper get mention on the quantum diary physic blog .
really ? what 'd they say ?
uh , it 's basically a summary of the theory , but there 's a bunch of positive comment on the message board .
oh , nice to meet you , mr insightful .
oh , the pleasure be mine , mr . innovative . uh , another one say the concept show some real out-of-the-box think . do you hear that , mr out-of-the ?
i do , indeed , mr box-thinking .
how be you today , mr can-you-believe-these-jack-asses ?
just dandy , mr i-wish-i-was-better-at-improv .
read another one .
well , i 'm respond to it .
uh , do n't low yourself to their level .
look , i be simply go to defend our work , scientist to scientist . and fail that , suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lover .
sheldon , my name 's on that paper , too . there 's no upside to do this .
he just left another comment .
what do it say ?
do it .
you mess with the bull , you get the horn . i 'm about to show this guy just how horny i can be .
doctor , please help me . i think i might be turn into a killer gorilla .
because regular gorilla be vegetarian , and i just bit the finger off your receptionist .
okay , we 've see plenty .
careful . she 'll bite your finger off .
okay , well , i 've be poke around the internet , and i think i found something we 'll enjoy watch even more .
what be it ?
oh , just a video of bernadette in a beauty pageant .
what ?
you look like a talk cupcake .
do he respond yet ?
hmm . no , not yet .
well , maybe we should n't have sunk to his level .
it be n't that bad .
read it back one more time .
we 're just stand behind her . it 's not like we 're gon na say boo and scare her .
how could you not tell u you be in beauty pageant ?
it be . it truly be .
no .
why ? what do i do ?
okay . we be reading that right now .
no , please do n't .
but it 's personal .
why ? be it about you and sheldon ?
no .
oh , my god , it 's about her and sheldon .
it 's not about me and sheldon . it 's about a young woman in the 1800s name amelia , and the time-traveling physicist name cooper she fall in love with .
please show u ?
no .
you know i 'm gon na read it either way .
good luck find it .
amelia and the time-trav found it . it be just past dawn on the prairie , and like every morning , amelia prepared to do her chore . except something about this morning felt different .
he still have n't respond . what 's take him so long ?
do you really want him to write back ?
yeah , i do . then no matter how he responds , i be go to destroy him with a picture of a bore cat say oh , really ?
me-wow .
what be you do ?

be that really true ?
of course , that 's how you know it 's a good joke . it not only entertains , it informs .

oh , no , me a well . uh , please e-mail it to sheldon at bazinga dot biz . why dot biz ? because i just give you the business . and also bazinga dot com be take .
well , i 'd be think about a cellular automaton approach to neuronal connectivity , and i thought it might have some interest application to string theory , it 's not a big deal .
oh , really ? when i be do string theory and hit a dead end , why do n't you try to help me ?
i do . you say the only math biologist know be if you have three frog and one hop away , that leaf two frog .
that 's pretty funny , that do sound like me . but that do n't mean that you should be stand on street corner hand out your math to whatever guy come along .
sheldon , we 're all scientist . i help out a fellow colleague . you 're be petty .
well , i 'm her son , how come she do n't send someone to check on me if i 'm lonely ?
hey .
you okay ?
if i be okay , i would 've say hello , and not the much more ominous hello .
what 's go on ?
i 'm mad at amy .
do she leave pit stain in your favourite crop top , too ?
no . she help barry kripke make an advancement in string theory .
why would she do this to me ?
well , i 'm sure she do n't upset you on purpose . besides , be n't you the one who say there 's nothing more important than the advancement of science ?
no , i say there 's nothing more important than me advance science .
all right , well , if i 'm understand this right , and all she do be help out another scientist , i 'm think you might have to let this one go .
be that all you have ? shopworn tidbit like talk to her and let it go ? gee , penny , life 's give me lemon . what should i do ?
well , you could shove them somewhere .
okay , now you 're get creative .
no problem .

no .
oh , give me that . just out of curiosity , if i be to let something go , how would i do that ?
i do n't know , just think about something else .
can i think about the spiny anteater ?
sure .
the spiny anteater never go behind my back and work with barry kripke . that do n't help at all .
you know , some people try visualization .
how do that work ?
okay , imagine your problem be a pen .
okay .
now imagine you 're hold that pen .
okay .
now open your hand and let it go .
but i just get this pen . it 's get my initial on it and everything . look .
sheldon , this be n't that hard .
i may have a well way that you can teach me .
how ?
what if i told you that over the past few month amy have secretly be give you little puzzle to test your intelligence against chimpanzee in her lab ?
what ? she do n't give me any puzzle .
be you sure ?

darn it . there 's something in my eye , and i need to sort these coin by size . can you help ?
penny ? i really want to eat this banana , but it 's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box .
son of a bitch .
okay , that 's great . now , let it go .
i ca n't believe you be test me against a chimp .
well , excuse me , amy be test you . i be root for you . good job on that banana box , by the way .
no , no . we design an experiment involve you . see ? now , be n't that interest ?
it 's not interest . it 's incredibly insult .
okay , maybe this will help . imagine you 're hold a pen . before you go too far , not a special pen with your initial engrave on it , that 'll make the next part really hard .
oh , my , that 's it . get out .
i do n't understand why you 're mad at me . you should be mad at amy . like i be this afternoon . hey , look at that , i let it go .
penny ?
what ?
i think i left my pen in there .
that be a good point . but i do n't marry you for good point . i married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous i 'm be .

that would be great .
so should we go talk to him ?
what ? the , the guy who play jon snow be a jerk . we still watch game of throne .

it 's not a big deal . i run test like this on undergrad all the time . if you fill out some paperwork at the university , i can get you five dollar .
i do n't want five dollar . i want my dignity .
so what be we talk , like , ten buck ?
thank you .
thanks .

i want a picture with nathan fillion .
what do you think ?
ah , it 's good enough for facebook .
i know , it 's so insult . at one point , they have me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box .
wait , sheldon give me a banana in a box . he be test me , too .
and how could a chimp even solve that ? that be impossible .
really ? you could n't get it out ?
thank you .
wow , the store look great .
so you guy be test u both ? what be the matter with you ?
eh , what 's the matter with them be they think they 're so smart they do n't care if they hurt other people 's feeling .
that 's not true .
that sound like u . i still do n't understand why you 're upset . you solve every puzzle faster than all of the chimp .
well , except barnabas , but he be on adderall .
i 'm sorry , but it 's make me crazy .
oh , i can help you with that . imagine you 're hold an ordinary pen . while your favourite pen be safe and secure in your pocket .
how can i make this up to you ?
the answer 's in this puzzle box . let 's see if you can open it .
that 's what i say when we move it .
no , stuart picked out those throw pillow all on his own .
hey , you okay ?
no .
my mom die .
uh , that be my aunt . ma take a nap . she never woke up .
i 'm so sorry .
what can we do ?

i really thought he be gon na say let it go .
okay , thanks , bernadette . travel safe . okay , bye . well , they 've book a flight . they 're head to the airport now .
how 's howard hold up ?
he 's hang in there .
how be you do , stuart ?
one of u would have take you in .
she do that to me , too .
i do n't care for her yell . but now that i 'm not go to hear it again , i 'm sad .
if you want , i can yell at you later .
it wo n't be a good .
let 's have a toast . to mr wolowitz . a love mother to all of u . we 'll miss you .
i just read about an experiment design to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hour .
that do n't sound right . my research have show that it take three to five year of shameless beg .
honey , neither of u come off good in that story .
yeah , i , i , i saw that article you 're talk about . uh , the participant ask each other a series of question design to promote intimacy .
and then they finish it off by star into each other 's eye for four minute .
oh , that 's nonsense . i proclaim my love for you . and the last time i look into your eye be when you thought you have conjunctivitis .
other than the fact that i have it , that be a magical night .
what ? i do n't need science to win her heart . i have my family 's wealth for that .
oh , careful . you 're poke at the whole foundation of the bachelor .
yeah , but we do n't have to debate this . we 're scientist . we can conduct our own research . i propose that we imprison two street people and
you do n't even let me finish .
forget it .
so , you can experiment on all the ape you want . but i want to manipulate the emotion of two captive human being , suddenly i 'm the monster .
why do n't you just do the test ?
in the interest of science , i 'd be willing to .
yes .
please , can i do it with him ? please ?
i 've be listen to sheldon 's feeling on thing for ten year . tag , you 're it .
yeah , but what if the experiment work ?
i 'm not gon na fall in love with sheldon .
that 's what i say . before i knew it , he pontificate his way right into my heart .
uh , fun fact , pontificate come from the latin word pontifex , which mean bridge builder or pope .
in love yet ?
okay , babe , let 's do this .
you guy be really be calm about penny and sheldon do this thing . if it be me i 'd , i 'd be a little nervous .
why ?
well , that 's what the bully at bruce lee 's high school thought . and then , bam . karate .
well , be we just gon na sit here while they do the experiment ?
the two of u could do it .
yeah , sure , that might be fun .
what 's the first question ?
hang on . okay . give the choice of anyone in the world , whom would you want a a dinner guest ?
hmm . i can honestly say penny .
oh , then i choose a janitor , 'cause i 'm about to throw up .
i 'm in love . let 's do something else .
sound good .
should we call howard and bernadette ?
i do n't know what time their plane get in , but let me , let me shoot them a text .
not much , but he seem to be in a pretty good place .
be you kid me ? you lose my mother 's ash ?
all right , fine . where do you misroute the only woman who ever love me ? the first , well , first , i meant first .
i really do mean first .
the world 's great mom be in the shoe compartment .
you ready to begin ?
yup . be right there . i assume you do n't want wine .
correct . you 're not suppose to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery .
what heavy machinery ? let 's just start .
hmm . living or dead ?
just say anyone in the world . i guess that mean living .
well , i have n't . and while they say never meet your hero , i just do n't see how i could disappoint . who would you choose ?
robert downey , jr .
oh , i do n't think of iron man . you know , maybe after myself and i have dinner , we can meet you two for dessert .
so , what do you guy want to do ?
well , we 're the one tag along , you pick .
yeah , why ?
you do n't mention leonard .
i do n't think so . leonard ca n't stand yoga , the beach , massage or dance .
yeah , well , he brought a book , okay ? what 's yours ?
who do you think make the french toast with butter and syrup ?
lady ?
yup .
oh .
this be cool .
so , how do we start ?
uh , be n't there suppose to be a zombie ?
ooh . okay , let 's hope one of the clue be write on a pair of clean underwear .
so , some stranger have my mom ? be that what you 're tell me ? my poor mother can be anywhere in los angeles right now ?
oh , okay , great . so , your entire job be to find lose luggage , and you 've narrow down the location of my mother to the planet earth .
if you could wake up tomorrow have gain any one quality or ability , what would it be ?
well , not to steal from the bible , but turn water into wine sound pretty good .
i do n't think you 're take this seriously .
i believe what you 're do be use humour to avoid vulnerability .
fine . honestly , if i could have one quality , i wish i could be a smart a you guy .
ha . keep dream .
sheldon .
when be we go to get robot eye ?
you 're all alike .

you sure it 's not too much bible juice ?
and the wave be go .

i 'm put the city name in the grid now . i 'm sure that 'll give u the code to the safe .
yup . get the code .
no , i 'm not leave without her .
i could 've driven her .
the day she left for florida . she ask me to drive her to the airport . i be too busy . and i make her take a cab . i be too busy .
which book be we look for ?
uh , origin of specie .
here it be . there 's a black light .
i bet the key 's behind it .
so , that 's the key to the door ? that 's it ?
we spent two hundred dollar on six minute of fun ?
it 's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter , and it just flew away .
well , to be fair , we do all have advanced degree .
so , it would be today ? huh . well , i suppose there 's something satisfy about die on my birthday .
today 's your birthday ?
yes .
well , that 's always be a secret . not even amy know .
well , i do n't enjoy present . and the thought of people jumping out and yell surprise fill me with more dread than the word george lucas director 's cut .
so , why do you finally tell me ?
the point of the experiment be to be completely honest with each other .
well , thank you for share it with me . i wo n't tell anyone .
thank you .
that be so funny . i never would have pegged you for a pisces .
you 're make it difficult to love you right now .
oh , thank god . it 's okay , she 's here . ma 's here .

of course you be , i 'm warm and soothe . i 'm like a human bowl of tomato soup .
i meant more like a little brother .

what ?
just think about the day i met you and leonard .
it be a monday afternoon . you join u for indian food .
yeah , and you 're still eat our food .
i remember it perfectly . but i have an eidetic memory . if you 're interested , i also remember how much you owe u for the food .
that 's it . that be n't so bad .
and i , you . and yes , that 's how you say that . yeah , so , give our newfound intimacy , i 'd say we have some hard choice to make .

ugh , this again . amy , i 've already have one new hole torn in my body today . i do n't need another one .
sheldon , i know the odds of you even go to mar be incredibly small , but it still hurt that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever .
so you 're say you would n't leave me for the chance to be one of the first human to colonize another planet ?
huh , that 's exactly what leonard , wolowitz , koothrappali , bernadette and penny say .
and who say you could even survive an interplanetary mission , anyway ? you could barely survive a tiny turtle bite .
you know what ? go to mar , sheldon .
be there anything i can do to cheer you up ?
what if i play the star trek theme on my nose ?
please do n't .
yep , you 're mad .

and in that future , be we on the same planet ? because i 've see people make the long-distance thing work .
we 're on the same planet .
okay . do that planet have to be earth ?
be you ask me to go to mar with you ?
you just ca n't keep it in your space pant , can you ?
think about it . if we have a family there , our kid would be martian .
good idea . and since you 've have such a rough day , i 'm gon na let you throw the pie in leonard 's face .
thank you for forgive me .
well , it almost happen when you call my apple pie crust doughy , but the truth be you be right , and i be just angry at myself .

i 'd say i 'm sorry i ask , except i do n't .
oh , look , it 's the scientific american that cover the paper leonard and i write .
oh , let me see .
i have mixed feeling about do interview . i like the part where i talk . i do not like the part where the other man talk .
sheldon , this article do n't mention leonard at all .
well , that ca n't be right .
it only refers to dr cooper and his team . do you even talk about him ?
all i do be answer a few question about the theory . and then express my gratitude that scientific american do n't include any of those smelly perfume card .
poor leonard .
why ? the theory he come up with just get mention in scientific american . he ought to be thrill .
he might not be .
oh , maybe you 're right . he be kind of a lump .
think about it . how would you feel if you be refer to a part of leonard 's team ?
oh , i 'd be incense .
so you see what i 'm get at ?
squeaky wheel get the grease ?
no .
grass be always greener ?
try again .
well , i do n't know , we 're all groot ? just tell me .
leonard be a much a part of this paper a you be , and he be overlook . he 's go to feel bad .
but it be n't my fault . i do n't exclude him . and i do n't write the article .
remember that time you do n't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland and they let that other kid do it ?
oh , that kid . poor leonard .
exactly .
for the record , that kid be a terrible choice . if you cry when you drop your churro , you do not have what it take to rule england .
thanks for help u sort through all my mom 's stuff .
well , it 's hard . a lot of ma 's stuff brings back fond memory .
leonard ? have you ever notice that only my name be on the cable bill ?
yeah .
good , good . and your name be on the electric bill and mine be n't . and i 'm okay with that .
actually , your name be on the electric bill .
oh , right . this be a disaster .
i do n't even know what you 're talk about and i agree .
okay , i have to tell you something , but you 're not go to like it .
an article be just publish in scientific american about our theory .
do they hate it ?
so what 's the problem ?
you know how the pennysaver only have my name
sheldon .
they do n't mention you in the article . only me .
really ?
i know . it 's not fair . let the anger go , buddy . you just , you relax all your muscle . except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter . let 's keep those tight .
it be . they 're what hold back the urine and the faeces . look , maybe , maybe you should n't read it . it 'll only make you feel bad .
cooper and his team ?
you should know i have nothing to do with that .
uh , at least they 're talk about the theory . i mean , that 's what 's important .
well , i 'd give more example , but , well , everyone in your position 's so forgettable .
stuart , we 're here .
it 's nice of you to let him keep stay at your mom 's house .
yeah , well , i try put him out on the curb , but nobody take him .
wait , when do it go out ?
oh , my god .
it 's all defrost .
no . all ma 's food be gon na be ruin .
i 'll tell you exactly what we 're gon na do . we 're gon na eat it .
all you say be i have to get rid of thing . you do n't say they could n't pas through my colon first .
okay . then how about this ? let 's invite everyone over to dinner . it 'll be like ma 's feed u one last time .
me , too . oh , look , we 've get enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it .
i mean , who even read scientific american ?
it 's kind of a big deal .
if it 's such a big deal , how come the big celebrity they could get for the cover be a molecule ?
i 'm sorry . what can i do ?
nothing , i 'm fine .
no , no . i 'm gon na cheer you up . here we go .
what be we do ?
i be take you shopping .
oh .
my baby be sad , and i 'm gon na make him happy again .
look , i know shopping cheer you up , but it 's just not really my thing .
well , what about this helicopter you control with an ipad ?
do it have a camera in it ?
it do have a camera in it .
baby 's listen .
i spoke to the reporter at the magazine .
what happen ? do you tell him it be my idea ?
i do .
thank you . what do he say ?
he say they make the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist .
why do he think you 're the lead scientist ? it be my idea .
you know , for an extra four buck , i can have this thing here tomorrow .
if you 're try to make me feel well , it 's not work .
well then what if i told you that i add your name to the cable bill ?
no .
fine . then grumpy , what 's he so grumpy about ? maybe his girlfriend wo n't take his side .
well , do n't he do a lot of the work ?
and that 's why you get an ipad helicopter .
be it my fault i have a much big reputation than he do ?
it 's not your fault .
be it my fault that my name come first on the paper alphabetically ?
not your fault .
be it my fault that when the reporter cite me a the lead scientist i do n't correct him ?
hey , look at that pretty bird .
he always need all the attention . he 's such a baby .
i know , i know .
i swear , he be never ever play with my helicopter .
okay , i 'll start heating some of this stuff up .
oh , man . this be the boutonniere from my high school prom . a piece of cake from my bar mitzvah .
no . if i find my foreskin , i 'm gon na kill myself .
okay , so we 've get , um , three brisket , four meatloaf , one lasagna .
no , that 's noodle kugel .
ma always kept it on hand , in case i get sick . she thought she could cure anything with her cooking . even the time i get food poison . from her cooking .
you get it .
i 'm never gon na talk to her again .
no . i want to do this .
okay .
i 'm not make any promise .
of course .
so , stuart , have you thought about what you 'd do if howard sell the house ?
hi . hello . oh , and a special hello to leonard , who need to be mention by name .
subtle .
but you get it , right ?
hey , guy .
good food , good friend , and sometime around midnight , heartburn that make you pray for death .
do you need any help in the kitchen ?
fine .
of course .
this food be amaze .
mm , and not a vegetable in sight .
that 's not true . we 've get tomato right here .
all these bright people sit around a table by candlelight . feel like we could be an 18th century french salon .
indeed . penny , a salon be a gathering where intellectual entertain each other with sparkle conversation about issue of the day .
oh , so it 's like the view .
sheldon , the view be a daytime talk show host by woman .
shut up .
i would like to propose a salon topic .
ooh , please do , rajesh .
the lead in the hunger game be a woman . marvel have make tor a female .
wait , who 's tor ?
certainly a lot more woman be reading comic book now .
we wo n't know if there 's equality until female thor have a baby and the avenger be cool with her pump breast milk at work .
i wonder if only a baby who be worthy can suckle at the bosom of thor .
okay , new salon topic . salon , dumb thing from a long time ago or interest thing make dumb by talk about superheroes ? discus .
i do n't believe it matter what the topic be . what 's crucial for a salon be that we conduct the discussion in an elevate and insightful way . it 's all about the execution .
of course you 'd focus on that rather than the inspiration . uh , new salon topic . what 's more important , an idea or it execution ?
guy .
no , it 's okay . we 're all adult try to have an intelligent discussion . at least i be . howard , what do you think ?
well , i guess , a an engineer , i lean towards execution . i spend my day try to take idea and make them real .
well say , old chap . i thought eloquence have die , here it stand before u . start today , it 'll go gettysburg address , i have a dream , and what he just say .
oh , now he 's a genius ? all you ever do be make fun of him and engineering .
leonard , please . his mother just die .
you 're be ridiculous .
yeah , so be you .
guy , if i want to hear people be bitchy , i 'd go to my real salon .
leonard , lot of people could 've have that idea , but very few people could 've work out the math the way i do .
lot of people also do n't have that idea , like everyone in the entire world except for me .
hey , you already ruin thor , give it a rest .
so i 'm just suppose to be okay with you hog all the credit ?
i do n't hog anything . unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisin in it .
you want some of this ? i 'll give you some .
she say my name first , that must kill you .
i do n't hear it .
no , not at all .
i do n't think i 've eat that much in my entire life .
you see , penny , the israelite be in the desert
shut up .
so glad you two be do fight .
right now , i 'm just try to burp without throw up .
hang on . physic today mention the paper .
who care ? do they mention leonard ?
they do .
leonard , i 've be work on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley .
oh , i like to laugh . but say it anyway .
okay , um , what do you say to a graduate of the uc berkeley physic department ? i 'll have fry with that . because his education have n't prepared him for a career in the science .
you know , when they chase you out of there , you only have to run faster than sheldon .
be you all set for your trip ?
yeah , i think so . i just restock the old prk .
prk ?
public restroom kit . everything a boy need for make pee pee in new and strange place .
i do n't see what 's crazy about bring a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell .
keep go .
would you like to play a physic car game i invent call i ca n't spy ? it 's all the nail-biting tension of i spy but the add fun of subatomic particle and wave outside the visible spectrum .
if it 's half a much fun a one time ten to the fourth bottle of beer on the wall , i 'm in .
i 'll begin . uh , i ca n't spy with my little eye something passing right through u .
that soy frappuccino i have .
will you please play the game ? i ca n't spy with my little eye something passing right through u .
we have n't be on a road trip in a while . this be fun .
we get it , you won the game . stop bragging .
no , listen , we write a paper together . now we get to go to a university and talk about it ? that 's pretty cool .
i suppose it be . in fact , if you 'd like to celebrate with a little music , i 'd be okay with that .
what ? this road trip just get crazy .
play that funky music , white boy .
i 'm surprised you know that reference .
what reference ?
can i be in charge of pricing ? i 've be go to garage sale my whole life . can you believe i get these pantyhose for a nickel ?
all right , amy 's in charge of pricing and be _ .
hey , penny , can you give me a hand with this ?
sure . oh , we have one of these grow up . i use to play all the time .
oh , yeah ? i love ping-pong .
oh , i meant beer pong .
i have a table , too , but i do n't have any friend , so all i do be serve .
and if i have a friend , they might have told me that .
excuse me . why be there a sticker on this ? it 's my tardis from doctor who . i be planning on move it in the house .
come on , one day , this may double in value and be worth half what i paid for it .
well , i guess a long a you 're keep an open mind .
so they 're request that the white boy play the funky music , yes ?
yes .
and this music we 're listen to right now be funky a well ?
sure .
let me ask you this . do you think this song be the music the white boy ultimately play ?
it could be .
so it 's like the musical equivalent of russell 's paradox , the question of whether the set of all set that do n't contain themselves a member contains itself ?
exactly .
make great time . gon na be there pretty early .
will our hotel room be ready ?
i doubt it .
be n't you worried that sit in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective ?
if we do , we 'll just tell him to hit the brick , see ?
oh , that 's true . it 's not like we can get in there .
why not ?
i do n't think george lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he want people drop in .
yoda 's swamp be in the middle of nowhere . tatooine be in the middle of nowhere . hoth be in the middle of nowhere . that 's code , leonard . he want u to drop in .
we do have time . i mean , we could drive by and just look at it .
yes . oh , i 'm so excite . and i just ca n't hide it .
i 'm about to lose control , and i think i like it .
what be you talk about ?
so when do you guy think you 're gon na move in ?
we 're still figure how much remodel we want to do .
have you make a decision about the tardis ? i think i can sell it if we call it big british porta-potty .
we 're not sell it , it 's mine .
that 's not fair . it 's like me challenge you to a sexy pant contest .
i would do that .
yes , but i mostly use it a a battlefield in an ongoing war between the transformer and the thundercats for control of a bra i have found in the wood .
bernadette , for every episode of doctor who leonard have make me sit through , i will play on your behalf and send that tardis back to gallifrey , where i hate that i know it belongs .
that 's not fair , she have upper body muscle .
dude , three-time sanskriti school for well-born boy badminton champion .
that 's right , okay , raj can play for me .
ooh , you just chose champion . it 's like we 're re-enacting the ancient german practice of trial by combat .
yeah , it 's also like when the mountain fought the red viper in game of throne .
no , no , i like that show . it 's get dragon and people do it .
so it 's settle . the fate of doctor who 's tardis will be decide by a game of throne inspire death-match on the battlefield of thundercats versus transformer .
if you still have that bra , i 'll give you a nickel for it .
there it be . it 's just a gate . on a road .
be n't even that hard to find .
this be so amaze .
i know . you want to get a picture ?
i want more than a picture . i want to go in .
well , so do i , but they 'll never let u .
be that the attitude that help you get penny ?
no , but i do n't have three year to make that gate feel sorry for me .
there 's a speaker box . drive up , push the button , and let 's see what happens .
okay , yeah . what do we have to lose ? i 'm a little nervous .
well , get over it . confidence be key in these situation .
right .
you push it , be you out of your mind ?
and that 's how it 's do .
all right , we 've defeat the first challenge . now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate .
we 're try to get past a security guard , not rescue zelda .
i think what really need to be rescue be your sense of whimsy , but one quest at a time . so what 's the plan ?
uh , i 'm just gon na be honest with the guy .
honesty will never get u in .
well , what 's your plan ?
all right , my plan be predicate on the assumption that they have a nurse 's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed .
uh , i 'm just gon na tell you the truth .
oh , you be kill me .
we do n't have an appointment . we , we 're just fan of mr lucas 's work , and we thought we 'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around .
what if i told you that i be the voice of yoda ? a record session i must attend .
i 'm sorry , do n't listen to him . we 're actually physicist . we 're give a lecture at berkeley later today . we just , we have some time to kill .
thank you so much . see ? maybe honesty be the best what be you do ?
shed the yoke of my oppressor , you blind , sad little man .
rajesh eight , penny four .
sorry , he 's really good .
what ?
yeah , what ?
we be . we be . oh , no . what a terrible serve . sorry , brother .
eight-five .
this be ridiculous . i want a new champion . amy , be you serious about be able to serve ?
uh , it , it 's be a long time . i do n't know . i 'm probably pretty rusty .
wow .
she 's my champion .
hey .
i care . oh , wait , no , i do n't . good luck , raj .
you know , i thought our friendship meant more to you .
so do i .
do you think they 're gon na call the police ?
oh , i think that 's below the pay grade of an imperial officer . stormtroopers be really the one who
oh , shut up .
uh-huh , i 'm normally very nice , but you shut up , too .
so , what be you in for ?
excuse me . leonard , they have a sculpture gallery .
we understand . thank you so much .
uh , one question about that picture . can it be with george lucas ? ooh , grumpy you be .
uh , yeah , i mean , her serve be pretty good .
okay , uh , i 'm gon na own you , bitch .
whoa .
what , and that 's not offensive ? where 's the line ?
it 's in your purse . play .
six . seven . eight . nine . ten-five .
it be , and now the serve be back to you , and the game be over .
do n't listen to her , just hit the ball .
keep talk .
be you still mad at me ?
yes , we miss our lecture , we be almost arrest , and you get me lock in a room with a man who force his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookiee .
boy , some people be just glass-half-empty .
the glass be empty , sheldon . it 's completely empty . if you give that glass to a man who be die of thirst , he would be dead , do you know why ?
before i answer , be he a smoker ? i think you 're look at this all wrong .
see ?
you do flop around a lot .
i 'll take your word for it . i be too busy try not to defecate .
you know , when they be escort u to the detain room , i look through a door , and i 'm pretty sure i saw a display case with the ark of the covenant .
that 's amaze .
i know .
and i saw jabba the hutt rid by on a motorcycle . although that be right after the tasing , so who can say for sure ?
i guess this could count a an adventure .
really should have thought this through .
i recently read that during world war two , joseph stalin have a research program to create supersoldiers by have woman impregnate by gorilla .
what a sick use of science .
hey , a long a the baby 's healthy .
i wonder if stalin consider any other animal .
hippo be the deadliest creature . a half-human , half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass .
yes , but when they 're hungry-hungry , you can stop them with marble .
yeah , the correct animal for interspecies supersolider be koala . you would wind up with an army so cute it could n't be attack .
but half-man , half-owl could fly
the answer be cuddly soldier with big flat nose . move on .
so , penny , when 's the new job start ?
next monday .
uh , not yet , but i will .
i say i 'll get to it .
i 'm sense awkwardness , be i right ?
yes .
swish .
well , the first few week will be all training . they 'll tell me everything i need to know .
okay , so what , you want me to be like a teacher 's pet ?
mm , i do n't know . who here have ever be hurt because they be the teacher 's pet ?
it be like the rest of the class want m mcdonald to forget the quiz .
mr davis . guess who ?
that 's right , good job . hello . uh , you want to see me ?
thank you . i assume you 'd like to reopen our dialogue about the university force me to continue with string theory ?
that 's the one . i believe you go last , so , uh , please ?
wow . pout and run away actually work . i must say , that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me . so , um , what be the solution ?
but if i 'm a professor , then i 'll have to teach a class .
so your solution be to promote me and pay me more money so that i can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientist ?
you people be sick .
hey . ready to go to lunch ?
just give me a minute . i 'm stimulate the pleasure cell of this starfish . i just need to turn it off .
what happens if you do n't ?
then i have to sit through lunch know this starfish be have a well day than i be . be bernadette meeting u at the restaurant ?
uh , no . actually , i do n't invite her .
how come ?
well , ever since she help me get this job , she wo n't stop bugging me .
well , i think she just want you to do well , and she 's worried that you wo n't 'cause you be just a stunningly poor waitress .
that be not true .
i 'm still wait on my mini corndogs from two year ago .
i told you , they 'll be right out .
okay , so no bernadette .
no , i just , i feel kind of uncomfortable talk about her like this . usually when someone 's be talk about behind their back , it 's me and it 's right in front of my face .
i 'm sorry . i just need a little break from her .
i understand . you know , there be some research that indicates that share negative attitude about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friend .
so , what be you say ?
i 'm say , in the spirit of science , what be that little skank 's problem ?
so , i 've be try to come up with a cute couple 's nickname for me and emily . what do you like well ? emippali or koothrapemily ?
why be it your last name and her first name ?
oh , well , her last name be sweeney , and something just do n't seem right about koothrapeeney .
hey , how 'd it go with human resource ?
awful . they 're allow me to move on from string theory , but they make me a junior professor and be require me to teach a class .
what a stupid question .
the kid be gon na love him .
this might not be that bad . uh , you like tell people they 're wrong .
wrong , just because i enjoy that one do n't mean i always do .
you enjoy give people grade .
a valid point , but unoriginal . b-minus .
and you love the sound of your own voice .
yeah , well , of course i do . listen to it . it 's like an earful of melt caramel .
look , most importantly , this will let you move on and study dark matter .
hey , what 's go on ?
no penny ?
because you get her the job and you think she should be work harder to prepare for it ?
that 's outrageous .
if she do n't do well , this could reflect poorly on you .
i do n't know . the important thing be i be here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party .
hey . we just want to see how your class be go . where be everybody ?
there be no class .
do you send everyone to the principal 's office already ?
no one sign up .
well , that 's not your fault .
i call the department secretary to see what happen . apparently , i have a reputation for be obnoxious .
what ?
hey , sheldon , i 'm sorry .
no , it 's fine . now i can devote all my time to dark matter .
aw , you brought cooky for everyone ?
yeah , why would you do that ?
i 'm think about get my doctorate , and he want to teach . why not ?
oh , howard . i appreciate the gesture , but this be a graduate-level physic class . i do n't think you 'd understand a single thing i be talk about .
ask why not again , i 've get an answer .
sheldon , i 'm more than smart enough to take your class .
no .
yes .
how would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution ?
i would guess a wave-function and then vary it parameter until i found the low energy solution .
hmm . do you know how to integrate x square time e to the minus x , without look it up ?
i 'd use feynman 's trick , differentiate under the integral sign .
okay . um , what be the correct interpretation of quantum mechanic ?
you take that back .
no .
so , after drink with bernadette , i get home , and penny call to complain about her . and then while i 'm talk to penny , i get a text from bernadette .
i be try to prepare my lesson plan for howard . why be you tell me this ?
because it 's take _ year , but high school be finally awesome . i love them both , but i 'm in the centre now , and i love that even more .
amy , please . i be try to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine .
but i 'm just
not now .
you well watch that attitude , buddy . you 're date the popular girl now .
hmm . you 're up late .
oh , i 'm work on my lesson plan for wolowitz . he be go to be so lose . look at this section over here . even i do n't really understand it .
sheldon , why be you do this ?
i 'm a teacher , leonard . it 's my job .
no , i mean , why be you go to so much trouble to prove that you 're smarter than wolowitz ?
oh , it 's no trouble , it 's actually a pleasure .
you want to know what i think ? i think the idea that someone could be a smart a you , or even smarter , scare the pant off you , and you ca n't deal with it .
interest point . you 're suggest that i have emotional issue below my consciousness which drive my behaviour , thus cause me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority .
might be something to think about .
leonard ?
yeah .
howard 's allergic to peanut . how can i use that against him ?
hey .
okay , now that everyone 's here , we can begin .
okay .
okay . well , then , uh , first thing first . um , be you familiar with the brachistochrone problem ?
i be .
good . and how it relates to the calculus of variation ?
wonderful . now , what about euler-lagrange theorem ?
that 's where i 'm a little fuzzy .
what be you do ?
everybody hand go up , up and they stay there !
what be you do ?
okay .
now , where be i ? let 's see . oh , yes . over here . you what be you do now ?
make a straw .

so i can shoot you with a spitball .
what ?
close enough . um , i be just call to see what you be up tonight . thought maybe we could hit up color me mine , maybe sneak in some pinot greej . whatevs .
uh , thanks , but i think i 'm gon na stay in and go over the stuff bernadette give me .
oh . oh , i hear you . try and get that nag off your back , right ? i mean , you 're not a bicycle , why 's she rid you like that ?
no , i think she be just try to help . plus , i really want to do well at this job . so
okay , good luck . and call me later , you know , if you decide she 's a bitch or something . hey , girlfriend .
tonight . you , me , color me mine . maybe we sneak in some pinot , make it color me wine .
oh . well , good luck get her to do that . she 's probably off get another manicure . you remember when she do that ? you remember ?
oh . great . i 'm happy for you guy . you know , when the two of you be n't get along , it put me in a really weird position .
you mean , like , where she 's nice to your face ? okay get it . bye . hey , boyfriend .
ca n't talk . spitball . probably gon na die .
well ?
sheldon , i promise . your uvula do not have an std .
you report me to human resource ?
you violate the sanctity of my mouth .
well , i drop your class , so i hope you 're happy .
i told you you be n't smart enough to take it .
i 'm smart enough , sheldon . ask me a bunch of question about a topic i 'm not familiar with do n't prove anything . i could do the same to you .
yeah , try me .
okay . you enjoy make fun of engineering so much , how do you quantify the strength of material ?
young 's modulus .
yeah . okay , how do you prevent eddy current in a transformer ?
laminate the core material .
come on , give him a hard one .
headache , dizziness and nausea .
those be also the side effect of have a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you .
uh , no . i can keep go .
okay , good . she seem like she really want to go out tonight .
okay , next question , for the butterfinger . how long be a galactic yea
_ million year .
yes .
okay , this one be for a cadbury creme egg .
oh ! it 's not even easter time . this be crazy .
which archimedean solid have _ regular triangular face , _ square face , _ pentagonal face , _ vertex and _ edge ?
we be so smart .
why do n't girl like u in high school ?
because we be awkward and weird and could n't play sport !
right again .
you 're wrong .
no , i 'm not .
yes , you be .
no , i 'm not . settle this . those little animate picture on the internet , be they call gifs or jifs ?
well , the g stand for graphic . that 's a hard g , so i 'd say gif .
i 'm sorry , do you mean the guy or the juy ?
well , i 'll give you three guess why i 'm so irritated .
something happen different from the way you want it .
i guess news travel fast . it 's true , a select group of scientist be invite to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman , and i be n't include .
oh , sheldon , i 'm sure it 's not because they do n't think you 're an elite scientist .
yeah , i bet you anything it 's just 'cause you 're a pain in the as .
you 're just say that to make me feel well .
look , you can spend the rest of the day be bitter about this .
agree .
i be gon na say or , but why bother ?
hey , i get you a little gift .
you know me . i 'm from india . i ca n't resist child beg . so , how 's it go with the title to the house ?
nope .
oh , it 's cool , i 've never be on a podcast before
well , you picked a good one to start . wil 's have lot of great guest . jonathan frakes , brent spiner , michael dorn , gate mcfadden .
those be star trek people .
yes .
i only figure that out because i 've never heard of any of them .
sorry .
yeah , so , how many people listen ?
what ? a few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff ?
can you please pas the salt ?
sure . it 's not like i be invite to richard feynman 's house and have anything well to do .
be this how the rest of the night 's go to be ?
i do n't know the future . do you think there 's a chance that an asteroid could hit the earth , destroy feynman 's house and everyone in it ?
no , sheldon .
then buckle up , you 're in for a cranky night .
you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff .
well , it applies to you , too .
you know , if you knock out this wall , it would give you an open floor plan , and then , it 's a little scary , but could be fun , indoor fire pit .
hey , i grow up in this house , okay ? no one 's knock anything down .
can i help you ?
yes .
wuh , uh , who 's your father ?
sam wolowitz be my father .
well , wait , so if we have the same father , be , be you say you 're my half-brother ?
i think i start to suspect it be a bad movie when i look at the script and saw the title , serial ape-ist _ : monkey see , monkey kill .
psst .

hey , great .
okay , well , i 'll apologize for the first time , but the other nine be on you .

oh , wow . i wish it be well .
aw .
seriously ?
you have a new job .
well , maybe i can do both .
i do n't think i ask you .
do you think there come a point in life when it stop feel bad to be left out of thing ?
probably not . it 's an evolutionary advantage to be include in group activity .
you know what ? i use to be a fan of evolution , but i 've since evolve , and now i think it 's dumb .
be left out be a terrible feel . no one understands that well than i do .
hey , look at that . even in your example , you 're all by yourself .
when there be a louse epidemic at my school , everybody get it except me . i try to fool everyone by sprinkle sugar in my hair , but i just get attack by bee .
i can just picture them all right now at feynman 's house , probably discuss schrodinger and at the same time , not discuss schrodinger . see ? they 're miss out on hilarious joke like that .
and at the same time , not .
you know , there 's nothing i can do about get you invite to the symposium , but if you want , we could build a fort
be n't that a little juvenile ?
more juvenile than this ?
i 'll get the blanket . you google how to have childlike fun .
you know what , i 'm be a bad host . let me get some more coffee .
no , i get it .
enough chitchat . how do we know you be who you say you be ?
okay , you get me there . you here look for money ?
a kidney , cornea , piece of his liver ?
you 're in a beatles cover band and you need howard to replace your dad a ringo .
okay , but something smell fishy . and not just because you work around sea animal . that actually sound interest , and i 'd like to learn more about it . hey , you okay ?
not really . this guy show up out of the blue , and now i have a brother ? my father have another family ?
i get it . what do you want to do ?
i do n't know . i , i 'd just like him to go away . i ca n't deal with this .

wait , twice ?
yeah .

that 's not what she meant .
but technically , yes .
hang on , if you 're make all this money , where be it ?
in a safe place .
what do that mean , under your bed ?
no , it mean a diversified portfolio of stock and bond . i 'm not overly conservative . i 'm young , so my guy say i can afford to take some risk .
wait a minute , you have a guy ?
do n't you have a guy ?
why would i have a guy ? i do n't have any money .
oh , sweetie , you should really get some money .
wil , i 'm beg you , just please turn that off .
that would be great , thank you .
it be actually just a mechanical hand .
you be my brother .
okay , so the final four fort in the first annual best fort ever contest , or fort off , be , fort knox , fort ticonderoga , fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket .
i 'd say , knox over ticonderoga , 'cause it 's get the gold .
mm-hmm .
and mcblanket over sumter 'cause it have a high thread count . oh . ten o'clock . date night 's over .
wait , no . we have n't picked a winner .
come on , i 'll help you take this down .
well , wait . what if , just this once , we suspend the date night parameter and you stay later ?
well , a long a we 're suspend the parameter , i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover .
that 's a big step .
it 's a big fort .
very well . i will agree to a family-friendly , g-rated , boy-girl sleepover .
pg . some scene may be too intense for young viewer .
g-rated , with a warn for family with baby and toddler .
you get yourself a sleepover .
do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajama ?
would it alarm you to know that i hid those thing here two year ago just in case this ever come up ?
it would , but you know how much i admire preparedness . how do you know we 'd be in the living room ?
who say this be the only one i hid ?
we built a fort .
be those my sheet ?
yes , they be .
okay . well , you kid have fun . i 'm gon na go to sleep .
well , leonard , do n't you want to see the inside of the fort ?
yeah , i 'm good .
oh , come on . i really want to tell someone they ca n't come in .
okay , fine . sheldon , may i please visit your fort ?
i want to say no , but it 's too glorious . get in here .
thank you .
okay , have a seat on the floor .
not there . that 's my spot .
sure .
really ?
yeah . well , i like music , i like science , i like make fun of sheldon . hit it .
perhaps you 'd prefer this one . the itsy bitsy spider be not an insect at all , because it haseight leg and two body part .
that 's pretty cool , sheldon .
thank you . do either of you know beyonce ? i 'd love her to get behind it .
hey .
hey .
hello .
you guy know the new discovery class mission that nasa 's be work on ?
yeah .
well , they 're look to include a message from earth in case one of them be encounter by alien life .
oh . when i encounter alien life , i discover that the key thing be not to sit in it spot .
all right , you ca n't breathe our air without an inhaler , he 's allergic to earth nut , but i 'm the alien .
anyway , i 'm among a handful of scientist that have be ask to submit a design proposal for the message and it delivery system .
excellent .
good for you .
congratulation .
be you kid ? yes . what do you have in mind ?
i 'll tell you exactly what you should do , avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm .
yeah , absolutely . you need a device capable of deliver information across a wide range of perceptual modality .
any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of object in space . so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic .
ooh , how about a 3-d tactile communicator rig for cross-sensory transposition ?
hey . thanks for come by .
yeah . i 'm excite to help .
i would have include the others , but you know exactly what would 've happen . they would 've take over the project and boss u around .
you should have told him to mind his own business .
yeah . that 's well than what i do say , which be , fine , i 'll eat them with club soda .
what make them think they 're always in charge of everything ?
mmm , they 're alpha male .
huh , what do that make u ?
we could be beta . they 're second in charge .
okay , that sound good .
or we could be omega . they get push around by the alpha and the beta .
okay , that sound like u .
whatever . there 's no alpha here , and this be your project . you 're in charge . how do you want to start ?
i do n't know . how do you want to start ?
i do n't know . should we call sheldon and howard ?
no . we can do this by ourselves .
okay . great . how do you want to start ?
i do n't know . how do you want to start ?
sheldon . sheldon . sheldon .
yeah , i kind of want to do it again .
i do n't recommend it . you 'll be do it the rest of your life . anyway , if you 're look for leonard , he 's with koothrappali .
uh , no , i actually come to talk to you .
how nice . here be some topic that interest me , quantum mechanic , train , flag .
no , no . it 's about my act career .
well .
oh , wait . no . how about we split the difference and discus why austria be an archduchy and not just a regular duchy .
okay , look , here 's the thing . i like pharmaceutical sale , it 's go great , but i have an audition for a movie , and if i get it , it could screw everything up .
well , why ?
i 'm attempt to turn over a new leaf . earlier today , it be point out to me that i tend to force my idea on people .
you 're really not gon na tell me ?
i be make molecular cocktail . this sphere be actually a cosmopolitan .
oh , just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit .
first take a picture with me .
you betcha . the very one .
i know . that 's why i 'm spending tonight with you .
with my honeybunch .
in social grouping , i just naturally wind up in charge .
you do n't think i 'm a leader ?
right . i could n't change if i want to .
all by myself .
so , often on the front of the locomotive be a large iron wedge for clearing object off the track . now , while commonly know a a cowcatcher , i prefer the more accurate cow exploder .
okay . sheldon , let me ask you a question .
if i be at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie , which train should i get on ?
be you use train to trick me into give you advice ?
no .
all right , then . you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on make a career decision until you have more information .
oh . you 're right . i 'm worried about something that have n't even happen yet . huh . you be a wise man .
well , penny , who 's smarter , the wise man or the person who come to him for advice ?
oh , i guess you 're right . maybe it be the person who asks .
no , it 's the wise man . that 's why he 's call the wise man . you know how i know that ? i 'm the wise man .
uh , just out of curiosity , why do n't you ask leonard for advice about this ?
‘ cause i already know what he 'll say . wah , wah , wah , you should n't do it .
ah , it 's just like he 's here .
okay , so we know that previous attempt to send a message into space , like the golden record on voyager , be heavily criticize .
well , alien could only play the golden record if they figure out how to build a record player .
that would be more helpful if e.t . be real .
well , my feeling be real when he be about to die .
my god , when he 's on the table and they use the paddle on him .
and he 's all white .
they zip him up in that bag .
and gertie ca n't stop cry .
the flower dy .
okay , let 's talk about something else .
all right , so it sound like we need a way to communicate that 's simple .
and do n't require outside machinery to be built to access it .
it 's also a problem because we do n't even know if the alien who find this can see . i mean , they might communicate in a totally different way than u .
like when my dog be mad at me , she tell me by pee in my slipper .
that 's actually a valid example . animal do deliver message through scent .
bee talk to each other by dance . whale have their song .
yeah . penny have about twenty different way of roll her eye that each mean something different .
okay , so , what it sound like be , what we want be a device that can deliver a message through not only sight , but other sens , a well .
the most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to posse be touch .
ooh . ooh , ooh . we could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium .
all we have to do be rig up a 3-d communication system .
we , we can totally do that .
this be great .
yeah , you know what else it be ?
what ?
exactly what sheldon and howard say .
well , thank you for pee in my slipper .
it 's the eye of the tiger , it 's the ear of the bat , it 's the whisker of the catfish and the walrus .
hang on . not that your song be n't terrible , it be . but how do you mention bat and leave out sonar ?
you do n't let me finish . and also regard the bat , it have sonar .
hey .
hello .
look , i know you guy be upset , but we 've talk about it , and we think it 'd be beneficial for you to be part of the project .
well , well , well , do you hear that , sheldon ?
we want you back on the project with u .
look , we admit it . the idea that you guy come up with be really good , and i 'd love your help .
i suppose it could n't have be easy for you to say that .
it be n't , so be you in ?
certainly .
sure .
great . now that we 're all on the same page , let 's get together tonight and work on it .
get together tonight ? leonard , stop try to control everything , and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do . go ahead , raj .
okay , i think we should do it right now .
tonight work well for me .
okay .
uh , building on that , we should order dinner .
how be that building on what he just say ?
building on what sheldon say , i could go for chinese .
hang on . building on what leonard say , no one built on what i say .
building on building on that , there 's a new build-your-own pizza place on colorado .
building on that , i 'd like to remind you , i 'm lactose intolerant .
i saw the menu . they have soy cheese .
bah , you do n't say building on . you 're out .
it 's not simon say .
yeah , you 're miss the point , sheldon .
you 're out , and you 're out . i win . who want pizza ?
oh , hey .
yeah , uh , i get a job a a pharmaceutical sale rep .
well , kind of . but now i get to act like inflame heart be only a mild side effect .
yeah , it 's go okay , but i do miss this sometimes .
mmm .
yeah . i start that rumour .
okay , since we agree on the delivery system for the message , maybe we should talk about what the message could be .
well , i think we should show what earthling look like .
the plaque they sent up on the pioneer probe have a draw of a naked man and woman on it .
yeah , i never care for that . it 's advertising to predator race just how soft and squishy we be .
squeeze yourself .
oh , do n't be offend . you know , of the four of u , you have the most veal-like consistency .
oh , you mean passive-aggressive like post picture of you and your wife eat cosmopolitan ball that you know belong in my mouth ?
perhaps howard meant passive-aggressive like ask our group to help on your project , and then only choose leonard .
look , i 'm sorry i hurt your feeling , but you do have strong personality and always end up take over .
it 's not always .
you let a guy sit on me .
he be dress a princess leia . it make a nice picture .
i 'm just say , sometimes raj and i feel push aside .
yeah . like when you take sheldon to texas and show him all around nasa , you do n't even think to ask me and leonard .
you know what ? you 're right . i should have ask you .
yeah , and if he do ask you , go . it 's amaze .
okay , and if we 're talk about be left out of thing , you guy go to skywalker ranch without u .
oh , i recommend that , too . that be a magical experience .
wait a minute . sheldon spent a whole day with james earl jones and never told any of u .
leonard , who 's really in charge ? the person in charge , or those who put him in charge ?
he 's right . if you think about it , we 're all in charge .
no , the guy in charge be in ch why be everyone so bad at these ?
i do , and you know , i do n't think i 've ever thanked you properly for help me get it .
well , thank you . you 're a good friend , and you change my life .
sure .
and you probably have to invite your other friend 'cause she overheard you talk about it , and it would be awkward to exclude her .
okay .
all right .
i , uh , huh .
greeting from planet earth . just turn left at alpha centauri . you ca n't miss it .
it 's , like , the best one they make , i just ca n't get it to work .
i 'll figure it out .
it stream hd video straight to your phone while it 's fly .
nice . where be you when i be single ?
okay , we should leave in about an hour . you all packed ?
uh , yeah , i just need to throw in a few last minute thing , you know , makeup , underwear , clothes .
if your bathroom floor count a a carry-on , you 're packed .
leonard , have you ever give a high school commencement speech before ?
nope . it 's pretty excite .
how would i be blind ?
at the end of the ceremony , all the student throw those pointy hat in the air . it 's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye .
i 'll take my chance .
fine . i wonder if they make i told you so card in braille .
look , the problem with commencement speech be that they 're boring . ooh , do you own a t-shirt cannon ?
why would he own a t-shirt cannon ?
i think it 's really nice that you 're share this experience with penny .
mm , i thought it 'd be fun to show her my old stomp ground . i even know the exact spot where they use to stomp me .
with a beautiful girl on your arm .
and a pointy hat stick out of your eyeball .
how 'd you get ready so fast ?
oh , i pack light . once , i get through an entire spring break with nothing but a long t-shirt and a belt .
it 's call an even look . i 've never be to new jersey before .
it get a bad rap from show like jersey shore and real housewife .
so it 's not really like that ?
no , it 's like that . well , i 'm excite to show you around .
you think we 'll have time to visit your mom over there ?
yes . we 'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press , but i 'm not do that either . uh-oh . i just get an alert . our flight 's be cancel .
yeah , look like there 's a big storm all up the east coast .
well , can we get on another airline ?
i do n't think so .
so , that 's it ? we 're not go ?
i guess not .

yeah . i work hard on that speech , too .
oh . you could tell it to me .
oh , thank you , but i 'm okay .
greeting , distinguish cheerleader .
ooh .

all i see be a black screen . and my own reflection . i look sad .
maybe we should recalibrate it .
all right .
step one , rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down position for at least ten time .
it actually say at least ?
yeah .
why would they say at least ? be it ten toggle ? be it a hundred toggle ? you know ? be it a thousand toggle ? ten thousand toggle ? a hundred thousand toggle ?
sheldon .
you see where i 'm go with this .
just flip the switch until the light on the drone change to solid yellow .
initiate rotation sequence . do n't look at me , initiate . what do red and yellow mean ?
it mean the calibration fail . we have to start over .
very well , thank you .
if you could feel how soft my skin be , you would n't have to ask .
no , daddy , no . there be lot of other way to teach me responsibility . i know , you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week .
just to be clear , financially or mid-sentence ?
no red and yellow , no red and yellow .
yay .
it 's green .
we do it . oh , if it 's this much fun to rotate , imagine when we fly it .
okay , now all i have to do be rotate it vertically until the light turn off .
oh , no .
wo n't that void the warranty ?
sheldon , i have a master 's degree in engineering . i wipe my bottom with warranty . except for applecare . that pay for itself in the long run .
hi .

well , i , how familiar be you with miniaturize integrate logic circuit ?
not very .
that right there be a miniaturize integrate logic circuit .
so , can you get it work ?
i 'm an mit-trained engineer . i 've built component for the space station .
i thought the zero-gravity toilet do n't work .
it work fine , it just be n't design for russian cosmonaut and their potato-based diet .
hey .
well , do n't worry . he go to mit . he can solve any problem , a long a it do n't originate in a russian man 's colon .
i do n't freak believe this .

what do they feed the lion , mother ?

and it 's the happiest day of our life .
ha-ha , do n't push it .
hello .

i 've be think about them , too , sheldon . be your girlfriend be so challenge . emotionally , physically . i 've be incredibly patient for year .
strongly disagree . go on .
okay , well , this be n't easy to say , because i love you , but i need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation .
oh .
i hope you understand .
okay .
bye , sheldon .
well , gollum , you 're an expert on ring . what do i do with this one ?
so , how do this game work ? i just throw it , like a real ball ?
all right .
i 'm heckle you . it 's a beloved part of baseball .
he 's right . and give that you 're probably still wait to be picked for a game that be played in fifth grade , i 'm sure you do suck .
hi . what 's go on ?
baseball .
okay , this be not what i meant when i say go outside and play .
he 's practice .
for what ?
the angel want an astronaut to throw out the first pitch , so guess who they call ?
what , you ? really ?
that 's so cool . congratulation . i guess that make you the athlete of the group .
i know . watch your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his leg be n't something you forget .
c'mon now , throw one .
all right , here we go .
you look like a jackass .
cut it out . you 're hurt my feeling .
now you know why we 're not outside .
no , and neither do our waiter .
well , if you 're go to serve cornish game hen , you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it .
it 's hard to argue with that . and i know because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail .
hey , how be dinner ?
good , i have cornish game hen .
oh , that poor waiter .
sheldon , how about tomorrow night we see a movie ?
you guy be go out two night in a row ?
i miss a number of date night while i be on my train trip , and i 'm contractually obligate to make them up under the term of the relationship agreement .
that 's so hot .
it 's well than hot , it 's binding .
if you 're free tomorrow night , i 'd love to have you join u on a double date .
aw .
you be aware that a double date do n't count a two date .
oh . well , then come or do n't . i do n't care .
hey , even professional pitcher need a rubdown after the game .
for your information , i also give leonard one hell of a high five .
they 're do space day and nasa ask me . i felt like i could n't say no .
thank you , that would be great .
what 's wrong with the way i run ?
sheldon , i 'm surprised you 'd choose to go to a pub .
at our committee meeting , amy make a motion for a picnic in a park , but i tacked so many amendment on that thing it sank like a lead balloon .
yeah , which i be initially sceptical of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding .
you do n't even like yorkshire pudding .
nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive .
ignore them , amy . they 're just jealous because they 'll never have a relationship a good a ours .
you do n't honestly think that , do you ?
leonard , i assume you knew . the rank of relationship in our circle by quality be me and amy , howard and bernadette , raj and his girlfriend , penny and chardonnay , penny and you .
there be n't any rank . and if there be , we would n't be at the bottom of it .
yeah , and actually , i drink sauvignon blanc .
relax .
there they go , fight again . you 'd never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc .
so you never played baseball a a kid , not even little league ?
well , i be go to , but the day of tryout i found my dad 's playboy collection . threw my arm out .
great . you take this and say when to stop . how much far ?
how about now ?
be you say stop and we 're just too far away to hear you ?
be you kid me ? !
there 's no way this be sixty foot .
you realize this be n't one of those time i want you to exaggerate how long something be .
okay , i get to , i , i , i , i get to ask . what make you think that your relationship be so wonderful and ours be n't ?
for starter , we enjoy spending time together .
so do we . and i 've see you guy ignore each other for hour do totally different thing .
it 's call parallel play .
not a well a we do .
you believe this guy ? he have to be the best at everything .
so what ? why do you even care ?
oh , listen to them . not even married and the honeymoon 's over .
whatever . you ca n't even go on a date without check your relationship agreement .
that 's your help ? that 's like say here 's how you fly a plane , get in the airplane , know where you want to go and fly it .
come on howard , fire it in .
so when do you guy plan on get married ?
uh , we 're not sure . but i want to wait long enough to prove to my mother i 'm not pregnant .
may i have one of your fry ?
of course . can i have a bite of your burger ?
absolutely not .
some perfect couple . he wo n't even share his food with her .
i 'm not jealous . i just think it 's silly for you to compare relationship like they 're something that can be quantify .
everything be quantifiable . that french fry ? a seven . spider-man ? a nine . the number nine ? oddly , only a four .
how ridiculous be he ?
a hundred .
sheldon , you 're just assign random number to thing base on your opinion .
not accord to the work of berscheid , snyder and omoto .
oh , what do those rascal do now ?
they developed the relationship closeness inventory , which predicts the stability of a couple base on behaviour .
so , this be accurate ?
it 's be around for _ year , and have be extensively corroborate by other researcher .
well , kind of take the romance out of relationship .
kind of ? it do it perfectly .
sheldon and i get an eight-point-two out of ten .
fine . we 'll take it right now .
no , do n't .
just do n't take it .
why not ?
‘ cause it 's stupid . who care what number it be ?
come on . it 'll be fun .
i say i do n't want you to . i 'm get another drink .
sorry .
i 'm gon na let you count this a two date . they 're a lot of work .
yup .
that be a close one .
be it too late for him to cancel ?
head up ! watch out !
be you mad at me ?
no , stop be stupid .
um , whew ? be this about the test , or be this about u ?
look , i do n't need a score on a test to make me worry about something i 'm already worried about .
that we 're engage and have nothing in common , and it scare me .
yeah , that scare me , too .
sometimes .
well , that 's not good . you be blindly infatuate with me be the rock we be building this relationship on .
hey , mike . listen , nasa ask me to throw out the first pitch at an angel game . you get any advice ?
why should n't i do it ?
but it 's for a good cause . what about all the kid that 'll be there ?
well , maybe i 'll do a good job .
okay , thanks for the pep talk .
hey , sorry about that .
why ? we won . you know , i say , next , we take on koothrappali and his dog . really give ourselves a challenge .
i just want to say one more thing about this . just because penny and i be very different people do not mean that we 're a bad couple .
let 's just take the test .
no , no , no , i do n't want to .
oh , well , 'cause you know we 're gon na do bad .
because it do n't matter . i do n't care if we 're a ten or a two .
or a one . a one be possible .
it would make me so happy if you say thing like that .
we get an eight-point-two . trust me , you 're happy .
mmm , i love how they put a waterfall at centre field . it really tie the whole stadium together .
look at you , talk sport .
this be fun , huh ? we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch , have a hot dog , watch the game .
whoa . nobody say anything about watch the game .
sheldon , what do you expect ?
i expect to see howard throw the baseball , finish my hot dog , and hightail it across the street to disneyland just in time for mickey 's soundsational parade .
i 'll tell you what . if we stay , i 'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead .
who 's the bobblehead of ?
do it matter ?
no , a long a it bobble .
thanks . i 'm proud of me , too .
let 's do it .
wish me luck .
thank you . thank you .
can he really throw a ball ?
yeah , that 's a no .
‘ cause i 'm an idiot who do n't think this through .
okay , new plan . we go to disneyland , play hide and seek on tom sawyer 's island , and then come back and see the end of the pitch .
he make a valid point .
okay , booing be n't gon na make it go any faster .
have you guy heard about this research team that 's try to transgenically manipulate chicken dna to create some sort of chicken dinosaur ?
oh , i think that sound wonderful .
what ? you 're afraid of both dinosaur and chicken .
yes , but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich would n't hit the mesozoic spot .
hey , guy .
hey .

yeah . i 'm excite to finally meet your girlfriend .
speak of which , accord to a recent study out of oxford university , when someone take on a new romantic partner , that person loses one or two close friend .
since when do you read social science ?
i go to the bathroom like everybody else .
why would i lose friend just because i start date someone ?
yeah , you do n't lose anyone when you met amy . yeah , well , no , this study refers to romantic partner . not the way i would categorize the two of u .
you guy kiss and hold hand .
i 've see him do it . it 's not romantic .
look , i 'm not the kind of guy who drop his friend just because he 's in a relationship .
well , hey , you 're my dear friend . you 'll get a christmas card for a couple of year , and then you 're dead to me .
so , howard , be stuart still living with your mom ?
i do n't want to talk about it .
hey , guy .
hello .
emily , you know almost everybody here .
and this be leonard , this be penny .
nice to finally meet you , too .
hi .
wow , raj , you be not lie about her .
i told you she exists .
hey , i hear you 're a dermatologist .
oh , i like their emergency room . yeah , even if it turn out you do n't have dengue fever , they still let you take a lollipop .
i have some odd freckle on my buttock . can i make an appointment for you to look at them ?
i 'm with him three year , nothing . she 's with him two minute , and he 's take his pant off .
i do n't know . i kind of get the sense she do n't like me .
of course not . no one ever say they do n't like you straight to your face .
we have lead different life .
yeah . you 're probably right . i use to think my high school p.e . teacher do n't like me , but it turn out , she like me a little too much .
yeah , i hope you 're right .
you really go your entire life without anyone say i hate you to your face ?
yeah .
i 'd say it now , but look at those cheekbone .
i miss stuart 's place . all this loud music and expose brick . what , be this a comic book store , or a rave at the third little pig 's house ?
yep , i wish stuart would reopen . i hate this place , too .
okay , him i believe because he 's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old 's tee shirt . but you 're just upset about stuart and your mom and all their hbos .
yes , i be . you know , i ca n't even watch game of throne now without think of mother say , stuart , which one be throne ?
you know , he might not reopen . he do n't get a lot of money from the insurance company .
oh , boy , if there be one thing that get my goat , it 's those dad-gum insurance company .
why ? because they wo n't get off your lawn ? be stuart try to get a loan , or , or find investor ?
all i know be , he 's get my mother buying four-ply toilet paper . i mean , four-ply . if his butt be so delicate , why do n't he just use an angora rabbit ?
for starter , they shed and bite .
hey , here 's a thought . why do n't we put up the rest of the money that stuart need ?
so , we 'd be , like , owner of a comic book store ?
that do sound fun .
ooh , maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place .
hey .
thank you so much for let me practice my sale pitch on you . i really appreciate it .
um , i brought coffee . i be n't sure what you like , so i get a regular , a cappuccino and a chai tea . since you like raj , i thought you might be into that .
so , femevra 's triphasic design provide balance hormonal exposure .
it have also be show to cause significantly few side effect than other oral contraceptive . although it can cause acne , which , if you ask me , kind of increase it effectiveness a a contraceptive .
okay , i 'm sorry . do we get off on the wrong foot ? because since the other night , i kind of feel like you might have a problem with me .
be you sure , because it do n't seem fine ?
oh , my god . tell me , what do i do ?
what ? oh , why would he say that ?
well , i would n't exactly call it a hook-up .
yeah .
yeah .
no . yeah .
so , what be some way we could set our comic book store apart from the competition ?
oh , kid buy comic book . it would be great to figure out a way to get more kid in the store .
you know , when i be a kid , i love go there , but i could never get a ride .
ooh , what if we get a van and drove around and picked kid up ?
nice . you mean , like at park and school ?
toy store , puppet show .
hold on . so , your idea be to get a van and cruise the street look for kid to pick up ?
yes .
and be you gon na use candy to lure them in ?
we be now .
you told emily we hooked up ?
why would you say that ?
we be have a conversation about past lover .
well , we be be honest . you would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped leonard ?
why say it ?

yeah .
hey , i read that someone invent a way to convert your footstep into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walk .

i 'll make the popcorn .

all right .
oh , this be already well . there be far few distraction in here .
plus , this be where our mind be condition to focus on work .
so , i 've be think about the hover board , and maybe there 's a way we could use maglev technology .
or if we could figure out a way to supercool the material , we could utilize quantum couple .
well , i wonder if anyone 's try that .
go online and look it up .
oh , i ca n't argue with him . it 's right there on the screen . austria do look like a wiener .
that 's nothing , dude . go check out how hung florida be .
i 'm sure mr florida 's walk funny . can we get back to work ?
yeah , he 's right . oh , here 's a thought . what if we use some form of operant conditioning technique to keep u from get off topic ?
like behavior modification ?
yeah , exactly . do you know those technique be use to actually teach pigeon to play ping-pong ?
that can not be true .
hey , it be match point .
not get to see who win at pigeon ping-pong come to mind .
we could snap a rubber band on our wrist every time we get sidetrack .
we have a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there .
yeah .
you guy look like you 're have fun .
we 're have the best time .
that 's a dollar .
hey , penny , hey , let 's go . we found a place that have australian male stripper .
that sound so great . but i have a little more study to do .
can you believe this nerd ?
okay , so we agree , whenever someone take u off topic they get their arm hair yanked off .
i think it 'll be pretty clear . if not , we 'll take a vote . oh , and also
ow . we do n't vote !
you say quantum couple . that make me think of the show quantum leap . that 's a tangent and it 's your fault .
that 's ridiculous . sheldon , i vote that be not a tangent .
thank you . and now i owe you one .
ow . that be your fault .
hey .
ooh , that be a lot of hair . ow . and now i 'm gon na hear it from jenny .
everyone stop . this be a stupid idea . negative reinforcement be n't work .

negative reinforcement be really wrong ?
no way . not bill murray .
huh . bill murray do get it wrong .
jump ahead to the stay puft marshmallow man .
no .
leonard 's right . we ca n't just jump ahead . we have to watch the whole movie .

okay , good .
oh , yeah , i 'd have to say it 's the most exit time in the history of the field .
i start do it .
you know , the government fund the big experiment yet to detect dark matter .
yeah , i 've read about that , they 're send research team down into abandon salt mine .
you know , sheldon , if we apply to be one of those team , we could be on the ground floor of something big , not just for theoretical physic but for astrophysics a well .
wait , hang on , you guy be gon na work in a mine ?
why not ?
perhaps the emotion you 're refer to be shock at you have something clean .
i think what penny meant be , the thought of you two in a mine be kind of funny , it 's like a cat rid a roomba .
if they get scar , they 'll have those hat with the light on them , 'cause down there it 's night-night all the time .
yeah , it 'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost .
be they make fun of u ?
yup .
i miss the old day when i could n't tell .
well , i be just say that there be this video game
yeah , that 's when i start think about work . uh , listen , i 've get some good news .
hmm .
this be for you .
huh . what be this ?

the one i give you ?
yeah . and there 's your money back , and now we 're even . how great be that ?
uh , yeah .
what ?
nothing .
oh , come on , leonard , i know the car be a thoughtful gesture and i really appreciate it , but it do n't make sense to have both .
you 're right .
well , good , because that 's what i do .
aw , oh , thank you . that be so sweet .
well , it 's not that sweet , i paid for the frame with your money and then get a massage .
you know what , you do n't have to give me this . you keep it .
why ?
the car be a gift , it be something you need . i be happy to help you out .
and i really appreciate it , but now i do n't need it , so here you go .
sweetie , i can buy my own stuff . i have a good job now .
i know , and i 'm proud of you , but that do n't mean i ca n't do something nice . like this .
okay , i do n't want this to turn into a fight .
i do n't , either .
great . thank you . can you pas the salt , please ?
sure . in my mind , that broke the tension with comedy and lead to sex .
hey , sheldon , you busy ?
now i 've get room for another thing . what do you want ?
it 's also a live mine , so there 'll be dynamite explosion go off in the distance .
yeah , i have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream . next .
yeah ? we have to be somewhere .
well , there 's no toilet , we 'll have to do our business in a bucket .
so it 's settle , we 're not do it .
look , i get it , but before we pas up on an incredible opportunity , i be think about when howard be training to go to space , they put him in a simulated environment .
interest . you 're suggest that we recreate the condition of the mine to see if we can handle it .
very well .
so where should we do it ?
well , i 'll just google hot , dark and moist , see what come up .
uh , sheldon
oh , there , well , look , there 's all kind of video .
hi . sure .
i be hop we could talk about the money again .
oh , sweetie , just forget about it .
no , no , no , no , hear me out . i know thing get a little weird last night .
well , leave an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count a weird .
well , i think i come up with a pretty good solution .
mm .
why do n't we just put the money in a joint account ? it 'll be our first money together . we can use it for the wedding , the honeymoon , whatever .
you know what , that 's great . i love that .
yeah , of course you do , i 'm not just a genius in bed . you sure be , baby .
you two want to be alone ?
i want you to know i get why you do n't want the money , you 've get this new job , you 're excite about be financially independent , and i be nothing but proud of you .
well , i just think that maybe you 're a little hung up on the money because i 'm less reliant on you now , and that 's a little scary .
hmm . maybe . or maybe i try to do something nice and maybe you have a problem with it because of your control issue .
well , i ca n't believe you 'd say that . you know how insecure i be about my insecurity .
you know what ? i 'm sorry . it 's stupid to fight over money .
yeah , i 'm sorry , too . we 're about to share the rest of our life together . it 's our money , who care who have it ?
ugh , you 're right , who care ? mm . get that money out of my back pocket or i will break your finger .
huh . all this time i never knew there be steam tunnel down here .
most university have them . when i be an undergrad , i spent three day in one pledge a sorority .
do you get in ?
no . they forgot i be there . but it really open up my pore .
well , accord to my research , the steam tunnel below this access point should be the closest analog to the mine .
this be gon na be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym .
plus , there 's almost no chance we 'll see any of our coworkers half naked .
all right , amy , this walkie-talkie be yours . if we run into any problem , i 'll contact you . and if anything bad happens , what 's the rule ?
save you first . come back for raj only if there 's time .
we 're go to be fine .
sheldon , i 'm really impressed you 're willing to try this .
yeah , a the person beneath you , allow me to say , i know .
how hot be it ?
uh , let 's see . _ ? no , wait , it 's on clock . uh , the real answer be n't much well . _ degree .

i brought a lot of significant asset into the relationship , too .
for your information , i just bought the last one i need on ebay .
there be only three minute left in the auction and it be a mint condition scotty from a smoke-free home .
not a lot .
let 's not talk about this in front of our friend .
for the tenth time , that be a groupon .
like i would swing with him .
how you feel ?
good . little claustrophobic .
let 's set up the equipment . it 'll help take your mind off of it .
miner often sang mining song to keep their spirit up .
just the hit . where it 's dark a a dungeon , and it 's damp a the dew .
where the danger be double , and the pleasure be few . where the rain never fall and the sun never shine , yes , it 's dark a a dungeon way down in the mine .
it 's a little more bleak than i thought .
well , i pray when i 'm dead and the age shall roll , that my body will blacken and turn into coal .
get kind of grim .
then i 'll look from the door of my heavenly home , and pity the miner that mine my poor bone .
okay . how 'bout a little miley cyrus next ?
who 's he ?
talk about waste money . what about the late fee on our credit card because somebody do n't pay the bill on time ?
oh , you 're say i do n't do anything around here . look at my chore chart .
she make him a chore chart .
i see it .
do the dish . there 's a star right there .
that pan have to soak and you know it .
it 's not an allowance . it 's a stipend , and we say we be n't gon na call it an allowance in front of my friend .
i usually do n't like lemon bar , but these , these be really good .
but you 're okay with superman conceal his identity with a pair of glass ?
he do n't just put on a pair of glass . he comb back his curlicue and affect a mild-mannered personality .
you guy do okay down there ?
i told you to use the walkie-talkie !
you guy do okay down there ?
please keep this channel clear for emergency . thank you .
i 'm go to the vend machine . do you want anything ?
this be a simulation . we have to survive on the supply we brought .
okay , just check .
we should have ask her to get some funyuns .
you 're not go to have funyuns when we 're a mile below the surface of the earth .
we 'll take some funyuns .
anything else ?
some york peppermint patty , a couple of dr pepper , and run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player and season one of a show call hannah montana .
have her get season two . season one , it be still find itself .
oh , do n't apologize .
yeah . it just make it a lot harder to pretend it never happen .
uh-oh .
what ?
well , if i do well in sale , i could end up make a lot more money than you .
not a problem . i grow up with a mother who emasculate my father financially and in every other aspect of his life , so really , it 's what i think love look like .
yeah i do n't want something dumb like money to come between u .
it wo n't . let 's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married .
why be you be so bossy ?
i 'm not a baby . i 'm a grown man , and i make the bed . now where 's my star ?
should we go ?
hang on . i want to see if he get the star .
oh , this heat be brutal .
a someone from the tropical subcontinent of india , you should know that fan yourself in a humid environment only raise your body temperature .
huh . that do explain why the servant use to look so hot while they be fan me . let 's get our mind off how uncomfortable we be . we could take some more simulated instrument reading .
my major focus at the moment be keep my claustrophobia at bay .
how 's that go ?
you tell me . i feel like i ca n't breathe , and i be tempt to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lung .
sheldon , if this be too much , we can stop .
we 're not stop
you do n't have to bite my head off .
i apologize . i just , i 'm plague by an internal struggle .
if you would just use the bucket , you 'd be so much more comfortable .
my struggle be emotional .
oh . be it amy ?
voyager the space probe or voyager the star trek tv show ?
the space probe .
good . because i be too hot and tire to go on about how much i hate voyager the tv show .
it 's too late for koothrappali . let 's go .
_ minute . that 's longer than i thought .
they 're in my shirt . they 're in my shirt . they 're in my shirt .
okay , this be definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money .
i 've never do it on a big old pile of cash before . me neither , leonard . it 's my first time , too .
it 's okay .
i want that , too .
ooh , laser tag , laser tag .
do you really need me to transcribe this ?
i 'm study one-celled organism to try and find the neurochemical that lead to the feel of shame .
same a all of u , get out of a car without underwear .
okay , if it 's sometimes howie wear yours , leonard already told u .
i think it 's awful .
why would you say that ?
bernadette be a successful microbiologist . she should be celebrate for her achievement , not her look . i mean , what kind of message do that send ?
i think the message be check out the rack on that scientist .
i just do n't think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead .
no , i think you should do whatever you want . you know , maybe if fashion magazine have female scientist in them , i would 've become a theoretical physicist . stop smirk at each other .
that 's humorous .
yeah , i bet you leave your patient in stitch . that be also humorous .
be you bring flower to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis ? that be n't a joke .
hmm . you know , they have delivery people that will do that for you .
great timing , food just get here .
ooh , siam palace ?
yes .
uh , mee krob and chicken satay ?
yes .
uh , extra peanut sauce ?
no , but you can have mine .
eh , well , very well . oh , and on the topic of share thing that be yours , there be a gentleman caller bring flower to your fiancee a we speak .
what ? why do n't you say that first ?
why do n't you get extra peanut sauce ? we can both play this game .
can i help you ?
may i ask why ?
i get it , i get it . listen , um , i think there 's be a misunderstand . see , penny be my fiancee .
i think so .
excuse me ?
hold on , doctor . leonard , where be your social skill ? this man be clearly upset . we should invite him in for a hot beverage .
so have these two , and they 're have dinner with u .
so , how be work today ?
what happen ?
well , i 'm really sorry , but i think it 's for the best . you want people focus on your achievement , not star at your breast in some magazine .
i sent the editor of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail .
i simply point out that they would never consider do an article rank male scientist on their sexuality , let alone show them in various stage of undress .
well , it do n't make a difference , because they agree it be in bad taste , and now you agree , so amy save the day .
but it be bad publicity .
i disagree . a a female scientist , i think what you do affect all of u .
you have a nice night .
here you go , doctor . red zinger with one teaspoon of honey .
oh , cool .
how 'd you get that ?
wait a minute . you 've snip gene roddenberry 's va deferens ?
that be amaze . how long have you be collect ?
what 'd you get ? what 'd you get ?
i would love to see your collection .
we know .
preach .
sure .
a gallant man would defend his fiancee for be call a urethra .
can we please change the subject ?
hi .
dr lorvis , what be you do here ?
really ? why ?
ah , that 's a good question . apparently someone be be awfully flirty while not wear their engagement ring , cause another someone to show up here think the first someone might be available .
oh , god . do n't make it so hard on her . look , the first someone be the deceitful you . the second someone be the delightful dr lorvis .
oh , this be very embarrass . dr lorvis , i be so sorry . i do not mean to lead you on .
oh . that 's why you be mumble mississippi .
can we talk in private ?
i 'll be right back .
so what other celebrity genitalia have you handle ?
so , uh , what 's the deal ? you take off your ring when you go to work ?
why ?
you be okay with that ?
no . i get upset . and sheldon make me a beverage , too .
okay , he just show up at my door . do n't you think that 's a little weird ?
a little , but he 's basically harmless . he 's actually kind of a nice guy .
okay . whatever , look , my company do not allow me to socialize with doctor outside of work . you get to get rid of him .
why be i the one that have to get rid of him ?
i ca n't do it , he 's my best client .
all right , i 'll get rid of him . but you owe me one .
hey , we 're go to oliver 's house to see his collection . you want to go with u ?
yeah , sure . you owe me .
oh , my god .
leonard , i be wrong . heaven do exist . and it 's in the basement of a urologist 's house in sherman oak .
oh , come on . it 's a replica .
the gun from hellboy ?
how do you get it ?
oh , i be hop for a juicy tidbit about ron perlman 's testicle .
still life with his ma . yikes , right ?
yeah , i 'm not quite sure how to respond .
wow , donkey kong . this , this be my game when i be a kid .
because it 's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursue by a small , oddly-shaped man ?
no , because i like it .
well , now , do n't get defensive . you 're oddly-shaped , but you get the girl .
yes . if you 'd like to join in , the premise be their love seem unlikely and doom to failure .
oh , if you want to get in on the pool , you 're too late . all the square have be purchase .
what ?
i 'm still upset about that peanut sauce .
nice flower .
be n't she lucky ?
what 's that ?
i guess that 's all anybody want .
well , i hope you get it .
next game , let 's switch helmet .
no , i 'd look silly in that helmet .

if you have ripped jean and a leather jacket , you 'd be like the toughest kid on the disney channel . so , anything else plan for tonight ?

wow , you look amaze .
thank you , so do you .
sheldon , you look so handsome .

oh , it 's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blade . try not to touch it when you 're dance .
excuse me .
i ca n't do this . and for your information , leonard , the upper flermin do n't grow between my shoulder blade , it grows out of the belly button on my neck .

sheldon , can i come in ?
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
why not ?
accord to an online message board , i may be have a panic attack . soccermom have similar symptom . but to be fair , the twin be a real handful that day .
you 're make me worry . what 's go on ?
what 's go on be we 're about to go to a prom . and there 's a great deal of pressure on young couple like u to engage in what mr bob eubanks call make whoopee .
what pressure ? all i say be you look handsome . can you please open the door ?
it 's not just that . leonard and penny also make comment about it . and i 'm not blind . even i look twice when i saw my posterior in these tuxedo pant .
be this what i sound like when i talk about india ?
so , my mother 's okay with this ?
‘ cause they have a weird , inappropriate relationship .
this be so mess up .

yeah , i watch . it be like the scary boat tunnel in willy wonka .
do they figure out what 's wrong ?
why would you have surgery ?
yeah , back off , he 's all mine .
sheldon , it 's a routine procedure , i 've heard you complain about his snore .
yes , for the first five or six year , but i 've gotten use to it . it help me sleep . he 's like my mucus-powered white noise machine .
sheldon , i 'm gon na get the surgery , it 's no big deal . end of story .
thank you .
i believe it be your turn in the game .
okay .
i think you could give a well clue .
i do n't . i 'm not even sure if that 's a person or a typo .
okay , why ?
i 'm listen to you snore . i 'm wonder how i 'll ever sleep without it .
if it help you sleep , then why be you sit here star at me like the albino boogeyman ?
what 's your problem ?
if the surgery be successful , the snore be go . and if you die during surgery , the snore be go .
it sound like either way , i finally get some rest .
i have to be honest with you leonard , i 'm truly worried .
well , i 've be do some research and i 've learn that one in _ people die from general anaesthesia .
buddy , wh , do you realize that that also mean _ people do n't die ?
i suppose that 's true . you 're such a glass half-full kind of guy . i 'm go to miss that .
oh , so , my , uh , parent ' 40th anniversary 's come up and i ca n't think of a thing to get them .
damn , can you imagine be married to someone for _ year ?
anyway , any idea on a gift ?
they use to like go to the mumbai symphony , but last year my mom thought they be phone it in . then my dad say base on their love life , she should know about phone it in .
hey . what 're you work on ?
remember when i say if you go through with your surgery , there be a one-in chance of die ?
yeah ?
well , i 've be crunch the number , and so far , i 've gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in _ .
great timing . my check sphincter light just go on .
leonard , what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon 's latex glove ?
i 'm not allergic to latex .
well , then why do n't you wear the rubber glove i bought for you to do the dish ?
for the same reason i do n't wear the apron or the hair net .
fine . what about epilepsy ?
i do n't have epilepsy , either .
you do n't , but the surgeon might , hmm ? and your carotid artery be just one shaky scalpel away from become the dance fountain at disneyland .
well , i do know that it wo n't be from an asteroid strike .
if there be an asteroid strike , would n't you die , too ?
i do n't know , i 'm smart and scrappy , i think i 'd find a way .
tell you what , the surgery 's not for a week , i 'll think about it .
thank you . and while you 're think about it , if you have the surgery in nicaragua during monsoon season , i can practically guarantee your death .
yes . okay . i , i understand . of course , yes . i 'll call you tomorrow . bye .
so i found this fence school in burbank that have a jedi class . and if you 're cool be the only adult there , they say they be .
dude , my parent just split up .
what ?
uh , that be my dad on the phone . he move out .
i 'm okay .
you do n't look okay .
the doctor say i should be out of surgery by ten .
okay . and sheldon really believe we 're at a public swim pool ?
he be so busy figure out how many part per million of urine we 'd be float around in , he do n't even question it .
_ part per million . and he 's still do it .
do n't worry about that . i 'm happy to take you to work .
it 's nice they 're get exercise .
although now that i think about it , leonard would never go swim in public without his swim shirt .
no , but last year , at magic mountain , he get such a bad sunburn , we have to cut him out of it .
he probably get a new one . finish your breakfast . look , there 's an entire section of my dashboard that do n't have any syrup on it .
you 're act odd . why ?
i 'm odd all the time , everyone know that . just last night i try to see how many fava bean i could fit in my mouth .
tell me the truth .
twenty eight .
come on .
fifty six .
amy . what 's go on ?
all right . do n't get upset , but , an earlier appointment open up for leonard and he 's get the surgery right now .
i see . take me to leonard .
just go to work , he 'll be fine .
amy , he 's my best friend , and if you do n't take me , i 'm go there anyway .
fine . it 's sweet that you care about him so much .
i do . and i would n't be able to forgive myself if something happen to him and i be n't at his bedside to say i told you so .
hello .
we have a really nice swim .
oh , stop it . i assume this medical centre 's already treat the burn on your bottom from the recent pant fire .
that 's for the fire marshal to determine .
you have to tell him ?
he wore me down . and i be distract , he have on extra baby powder today .
be he okay ?
he 's still in surgery .
very well .
come on , let 's talk about something other than the surgery .
that 's a good idea . penny , do you and leonard ever discus funeral arrangement ?
i think she meant something a little happier .
i suppose we could try to make it a celebration , but he die so young .
knock , knock .
hey . what brings you by ?
told you , not funny .
i 'm sorry . this be very sweet . thanks .
so , how you do ?
well . i guess the news just hit me a lot harder than i expect .
why ? your father barely speaks to your mother .
a you can see , we 're here to cheer you up .
i think , over time , they start to resent each other , and instead of talk about the thing that bother them , they kept it bottle up , and the hate just grow .
oh , it 's nice you get him that .
oh , this be n't for leonard , no . amy bought it for me .
stubbed his toe on the revolve door on the way in .
there be a large plant in the lobby . it kept look like the outside .
okay , listen , when leonard come out , he be not gon na feel great , so , please do n't give him a hard time .
penny have a good point . this be like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck . whatever you 're think , just keep it to yourself .
it be like a grapefruit .
and i 'm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it .
the reason i be be a pain in the b be because i be worried about him , and no one else be .
really ? you wo n't even say a ?
you bet your sweet b i wo n't .
obviously , i care about leonard . i 'm gon na spend the rest of my life with him .
and i 'm not ? it 's an earthquake . i knew it .
a little tremor that turn routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy . oh , i do n't care for this at all . oh , i need to see he 's okay .
try and stop me .
be you okay ?
why do n't you stop me ?
what be you talk about ? we 're fine . and raj 's parent probably split up because of raj .
they always say the child be n't to blame , but , come on .

oh , my god , i ca n't believe it .
this be so excite .
be , be you not happy about this ?
oh , that 's all right . all i heard be skinny .
i would n't make too much out of howard not react the way you expect him to .
yeah , i 'm sure it be just the initial shock of it all .
i should n't be raise a kid . i do n't even eat my own vegetable .
buddy , i , i think you might be overreact .
and then there 's this nose . i mean , what if he look like me ? or bad , what if she look like me ?
not to mention the impact on our social circle . everything 's go to change . howard wo n't be able to come over a much .
i read that in los angeles , raise a child through college can cost over a million dollar .
a million dollar ? god , it 's like my nut just kick me in the nut . that 's it , i get to start earn more money right now .
i know , you could ask bernadette for a raise in your allowance .
this be n't a joke .
i be n't joking .
it 'll be fine . people have kid every day . you 'll figure this out .
yeah , come on , this be great news and you know it .
you 're right , it be , i 'm just a little overwhelmed right now .
all get vasectomy so this do n't happen to u ?
go out and celebrate . but not your bad idea .
hey , let 's go do something to get your mind off this .
yeah , yeah , we should go out .
we can , but all right .
be you hungry ? how about that sushi place you love ?
okay , look , we do n't have to go anywhere . we can just , you know , stay here and hang out in the hot tub .
i 'd like to propose a toast to our friend , howard , his , um , his big heart , his beautiful soul
and his tight little pant that somehow do not make him sterile .
well , look at this . i bet whoever invent tiny umbrella do n't have to worry about money . he can have all the kid he want .
and can keep a small portion of their head dry .
if i 'm gon na have any chance of raise this kid , i need to come up with a big idea to make some money .
there 's no reason you ca n't .
that 's easy for you to say . you and sheldon already come up with your superfluid helium model .
that 's just research . we 're never gon na make any money from it .
forget helium . the real superfluid be the fruit punch in this mug . reminds me of my daddy 's secret do n't tell mama juice .
uh , these be strong , you should slow down .
okay , how about this for an invention , slightly big cocktail umbrella .
how be that a new invention ?
i do n't know , all apple do be change the size of thing and we keep buying them .
this place be terrific . why . why have we never be here before ?
the same reason we do n't do a lot of fun stuff . you .
that 's some smart talk from a guy who ca n't even keep his face in focus . where 's the bathroom ?

oh , i do n't think there will be .
yeah , we do our own search .
get a load of this guy .
can you imagine if we make money with this ?
if we do , i be splurge on the best sinus irrigator money can buy .
that old sad story , guy get a little money , go straight up his nose .
seventy-five percent ?
that 's outrageous . this be our idea base on our research . how can you possibly justify own a majority share ?
i know when i 'm beat .
hold on , hold on . so the three of u do all the work and only end up with _ % ?
well , until you just say that mean thing , kinda .
wait , so this can turn out to be a financial success , and i get nothing ?
well , that 's not fair . we should all get plaque .
sorry , but we ca n't sign this .
come on , let 's go .
thank you for your time .
couple of question about the plaque .
so , have you be have any morning sickness ?
but now you 'll be able to make your own milk to eat the cooky with .
hey , guy . hey , penny . i really appreciate you help me with this . i do n't know what to do .
oh , sure . let me see it .
see what ?
i have n't spoken to emily since i broke up with her , and she left this on my doorstep with a note .
raj , i get you this before we split up , but could n't return it and thought you 'd like to have it . happy belated valentine 's day , emily .
nice , or be she try to manipulate him ?
i know . i mean , do i open it ? do i return it ?
why would n't you open it ?
well , she be pretty mad . for all i know it 's a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk .
i know one way to find out . sniff this .
she 's pregnant , she 's not a bloodhound .
come on , just open it .
you know , on game of throne , balon greyjoy receive his son 's genitals in a box .
well , never hurt to have a spare .
wow . it 's an antique sextant . sailor use these to find their position by the star .
what a nice gift for an astrophysicist .
i know , she 's so thoughtful .
see , she 's try to get you back . now , that be exactly what i would 've gotten you if i have any idea what it be or what you do .
you know , i have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into get back together with her .
you do n't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap .
well , what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves ?
we ca n't . it say on their web site , a long a we work there , they have a control ownership of anything we come up with .
great , so they own my idea for a t-shirt that say dumb a a bag of geologist .
well , our choice be we do this with the university or we do n't do it at all .
or , if we end up make money from this , sheldon and i could split our share with you .
to be clear , leonard be refer to the gyroscope , not the t-shirt and mug . oh , now they own the mug .
i guess that be a way around this . you guy would be cool do it like that ?
of course , we can split any profit three way .
i 'm fine with that .
okay , great .
it sound like a , uh , contract might be in order .
sure , we could write something up .
but which one of u should be the party who
you can do it , sheldon .
so stipulate .
once i found a stash of contract under his bed . it be weird .
ooh , let 's find out .
it do n't matter . it 's the thought that count .
yeah , yeah , and beauty 's on the inside , size do n't matter , how much she spend ?
seriously , guy , i do n't want to know .
oh , come on , you ca n't say oh my , and then not tell me .
these thing go for five hundred dollar and up .
okay , so , she drop off a five hundred dollar gift and she 's not try to get back together with you ?
maybe you 're right .
hello ?
yeah , yeah . sure . what 's up ?
maybe , maybe .
i 'm sorry , i seem to be take an annoy amount of time decide how i feel about this .
i 'm sorry , i do n't think that 's a good idea .
be you sure you do n't want to stay here with u ?
no , i kind of feel like be alone right now .
thank you .
say hi to emily for u .
will do .
i 'll say it look good . it 's in my proprietary font , shelvetica .
well , we ran into a problem about my share of the patent , so we 're form a partnership to split anything we make equally .
sheldon , do you draft the contract ?
you bet i do .
ooh . you 're gon na make out so hard tonight .
excuse me . i 've be draft contract since kindergarten . do n't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting . do n't need one now .
bernie , the guy be nice enough to find a way to keep me from be cut out .
well , to be fair , howard 's idea be base on sheldon 's math .
honey , this be fine .
can i talk to you in the hall ?
excuse u .
hey , leonard .
what ?
if she do n't think that we should apply for this patent , she 's be patently absurd .
good one .
okay , you get it . see , i be afraid it be a thinker .
what be you do ?
what 's to think about ? we have an invention and want to move forward .
here we go with the ironclad logic again .
be the foetus help you ? ‘ cause that 's cheat .
hello ?
really ? i 'm sorry . i swear i know other word .
that 's exactly what she say . how do you know that ?
any chance you could send me a pdf of that playbook ?
they 've be out there a while .
i hope everything 's okay .
i wonder what they 're talk about .
hey .
hello .
you guy all right ?
yeah . but , um , we be talk , and i 'm a little concerned about the three of u form a partnership .
be you suggest a limited liability corporation ? ‘ cause i do not l-l-see that come .
well , i believe i 'm treat you generously . that 's why i 've stipulate in the contract that your contribution to our invention be a valuable a my own .
no , i be not say that , because i kept say that this morning and leonard say stop say that .
see ? this be what happens every time we work together .
you know what , hang on . what if sheldon have no choice but to be respectful ?
what ? be there a switch on the back of his neck we do n't know about ?
no . what i 'm say be you could add a clause to the contract that he ca n't make fun of howard .
oh , please . any contract i sign be enforce by my own personal code of ethic .
and his obsessive-compulsive disorder .
yeah , that , too . and scoot over . part of your shadow 's on my spot .
howard , what do you think ?
i 'll add it right now . oh , baby , it 's addendum time .
hey , emily , listen , i 've be think , and i 'm not sure it 's a good idea that i come over .
no , no . please do n't cry .
hey , so , listen , claire , change of plan
i do n't think so . she sound pretty upset .
emily , listen , i 'm sorry , but i ca n't come by .

a precocious little internet show know a fun with flag .
i 'm hang up .

sheldon , i be not do fun with flag with you .

because we 're broken up .
sonny and cher make it work . their variety show kept go long after the divorce , and here we be still talk about them .
no one 's talk about sonny and cher .
i ca n't believe you make out with mandy chao .
well , trust me , i wish it never happen .
and you do n't think to tell me ?
leonard ask me to keep it to myself .
let 's leave leonard out of this for the moment . this be about you and me .
wait , wait , wait , how be my day-old marriage fall apart become about you two ?
hang on . what do i need to do to make you trust me ?
you think it 's hard have one wife , try have two .
i bet you told bernadette all about how he be screw around with mandy chao .
oh , we do n't screw around . we just get drunk and make out .
whatever . it would have be nice to hear it from you .
what be you do here ?
i 'm here to return your belonging . that 's what people who 've broken up do .
and you do n't do your compulsive knock ritual so i would open the door .
on the contrary , you no longer get to enjoy my charm eccentricity . we 're not friend with benefit .
just give me the box .
wait . do n't you want to go through it to make sure i have n't forgotten anything ?
fine . my old scarf .
you wore it the night we go ice-skating . remember ?
you mean the night that i go ice-skating , and you stood at the rail google the symptom of hypothermia ?
whose bra be this ?
it 's not yours ? oh , my . how embarrass for both of u .
it 's penny 's .
hey , you broke up with me . it be none of your business whose naked bosom i 'm smooshing around like pizza dough .
good-bye .
amy . amy . amy . hmm . table work , too . good to know .
ooh , brownie for girl ' night !
look , i know it 's a lot of money , but the guy at the store say in five to seven year , it 'll pay for itself .
do n't matter . what be you mad about ?
and you have every right to be mad about those thing . so , why do n't you let me handle the credit card bill this month , huh ? i mean , do n't even look at it .
and i wish leonard never told me . he 's the bad guy here .
and you let penny marry him . compare to that , who care if i bought a george clooney limited edition manscaping kit ?
can we talk ?
i would love that .
all right , look , i 'm sorry i say i be okay with everything before we get married . i hate that we 're go through this , but i do n't know what to do .
if you do n't mind wait for a groupon , we can try marriage counsel .
hello .
hey , uh , buddy , can we have some privacy ?
oh , of course . would n't want to intrude . this be yours .
okay , when i 'm do with him , i 'm gon na need more information .
okay , look , i might be overreact , but how be i suppose to get past this when i know tomorrow you 're gon na go to work and see this woman ?
now , forgive me for eavesdropping , but a i see it , there 's a simple solution .
wake up , wake up , wake up .
bring penny to meet mandy .
what ? why ?
well , right now , penny 's imagination be run wild , but if they meet , that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fear . like when that sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch .
uh , first of all , you make that guy cry .
and we learn that you do n't need an eyeball to do that .
secondly , i ca n't think of a more horrible idea than penny meeting mandy .
really ? why be that ?
what , you actually want to meet her ?
no , but now that you 're be weird about it , maybe i should .
i 'm not be weird . be i be weird ?
yes . and that 's come from me .
no , i just want to know that when you 're at work , there 's nothing go on .
how many time do i have to tell you ? i have no interest in this woman .
yeah , well , maybe she have interest in you .
in leonard ? oh , even the sparkletts guy could see that 's unlikely .
i guess my big problem be i never saw leonard a the kind of guy who would do something like this .
what do you think ?
i want to believe you . i really do . be i be naive ?
you know , he never would 've do this when we first met . he 's cockier now .
_ dollar an hour . why ?
how do you know ?
bernadette and i have occasionally go to one to , you know , stay on top of thing .
dude , just because we 're best friend do n't mean that i have to tell you everything that go on .
you do n't have to , you should want to .
oh , great , there 's mandy .
why be marine biologist always so cute ?
i do n't know , but i 'd like to get lose in her bermuda triangle .
that 's not helpful .
then i wo n't say i 'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area .
not yet , this be fun . ooh , i know . i 'd let her free my willy . where you go ?
leonard , wait .
i 'd like to spongebob her squarepants .
now we be do .

you know , what we do , when we be drunk .
no , we just make out .
uh , okay , well , um , i get married recently .
never get old . no , no , to a girl . anyway , i told her what happen between you and me , and she 's concerned about u see each other at work .
because i do n't want there to be any secret between u .
what else would it be ?
no , i do n't think so . although , penny do say exactly that .
i mean , she 's really beautiful . she could have any guy she want . which be probably why it take her so many year to tell me she love me .
hey , leonard , when you 're do , we come up with a bunch more .
okay , yeah , um , do you remember when you accuse me of try to sabotage our wedding ?
uh-huh .
i 'm listen .
penny , after all these year , i still feel like maybe i do n't deserve you .
okay , that be the lame excuse you could 've possibly come up with . but i get it .
you do ?
yeah . yeah , sometimes i worry you 're gon na wake up and leave me for someone more like you .
i do n't even understand why you 're with someone like me . why would i want to be with someone like me ?
well , how about we stop be so scar of lose each other and just be together ?
that sound nice .
good . because i 've love you since the moment we met , and i will keep love you until the end of time .
yeah ? that 's because you 're beautiful , and your beauty fill my heart with love and song .
it 's get kind of cheesy , leonard .
huh ? if you think that 's cheesy , buckle up . penny hofstadter , will you please stay married to me ?
oh , damn it , you topped it . should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official ?

oh , no , no , i just , i say , whee .
how dare you go on the internet and say mean thing about me and compare my genitalia to part of czechoslovakia ?
you saw through that one , do you ?
i do n't know what you be think , but take the video down now .
she watch it . i 'm gon na get that girl back .
i only watch it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this be gon na make you mad .

hmm ? oh . amy show me a compelling study that demonstrate the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness .
buddy , i be ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there .
well , make your joke , but some of the participant who spent four day in the wood away from all technology report a fifty percent gain in reason skill upon their return .
okay , if that 's true , why be n't there more genius squirrel ?
you may need this more than i do .
you know , if you really want to be in nature , why do n't we rent a cabin ?
look , i 'm sorry , when do you even get here ? i

i know . do you see they still have a video rental place ? it 's like colonial williamsburg .
well , cell service be down to one bar , so if anyone need medical attention or to tell a stranger their political view be stupid , now 's the time .

once . the battery ran out on my phone . i have to wait for my ipad to turn on .
i be afraid he be gon na eat me .
raj just pull up . i 'm gon na say something to him .
so you do n't think he need to rein it in a little ?
and you 're not concerned he 's act like somehow this be his kid , too ?
just supportive . not over-the-top in any way ?
hello .
this place be great .
so nice of that doctor to just let you use it .
well , she be take me to an indigo girl concert , so hold that thought .

you 'll wish it would kill you .
so what do we do now ?
they have some board game .

hey , let 's light a fire .
ooh , that sound cozy .
i do n't think i 've lit a real fire before .
ah , it 's basic thermodynamics . i 'm sure we can figure that out .
i could stack the log conically to facilitate airflow .
that would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion .
right . so all we need be to
get it .
a scientist make that .
look , raj , you 're my best friend in the world and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby .
please , my pleasure .
but we have to set some boundary .
i do n't understand .

i 'm surprised you would do that .
oh , and how .
i feel like i just make a horrible mistake .
what ? be you gon na cry ?
be it baby hormone or actually sad ?
i 'll go get him .
this game 's dangerous . i could get you in trouble .

we 're married . we 're suppose to share everything .
what , you mean , like , your massive credit card debt ?
i 'm call it . i won .
i appreciate the apology , but it 's really not necessary . i overstep my bound .

my god , leonard , do you know what i could do with that kind of money ?
no , i do , and that 's why i hid it .
what good be it if you do n't use it ?
be it a secret bank account ? because that would be awesome .
i hate my job .
really ? why ?
because i do n't feel good flirt with doctor for sale . i mean , i know i make a lot of money . but i have n't be happy for a while .
why do n't you tell me ?
that 's not true .
okay , really ? so you 'd be fine if i go back to act and wait table again ?
if that 's what you want to do , yes .
well , it 's not what i want to do .
do n't matter what i want . look , this job be gon na get me out of debt . so i 'm gon na do the grown-up thing and see it through .
well , that be the grown-up thing .
i guess .
i love you .

well , be n't man-man just man ?
but what if man-man dress a a bat ?
well , that 's just batman .

no , i 'm actually date two woman . later .
seriously , that guy 's date two woman ?
what , why do you get a party sub ?
people be come over , it look fun .
well , we 're only watch game of throne . a party sub implies it 's a party .
your attendance implies it 's not .
hmm ? well , it sound like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting . lucky for you it 's tomorrow .
oh , you know what ? i 'm not go .
well , you have to go . it 's penny 's first time lead the pledge of allegiance .
this meeting be a waste of time . whether we make the switch from post raisin bran to kellogg 's raisin bran should not require parliamentary procedure .
you realize one of them have sugar on the raisin .
you 're the only one who eats them .
and yet you get to weigh in . democracy , it 's pretty cool , be n't it ?
i 'm not go , you ca n't make me .
well , we 'll just see about that .
he say he 's not come to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow .
well , why the hell do i memorize the pledge ?
you have fun . i will not be attend .
oh , fine . we do n't have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you do n't want to .
you 're be ridiculous .
well , why be you fight him on this ?
because i be tire of him always get his way . we do n't need a stupid meeting . we do n't even need a roommate agreement , and i hope that sandwich do cause a party .
well , i will still come to your meeting .
well , i should hope so . tomorrow 's picture day .
why be you take his side ?
because it 's important to him , and when we sign the roommate agreement , we make a deal .
man , i 'm worn out .
i know . imagine if we be actually move .
no , it 's just , ever since i start date claire and emily at the same time , it 's exhaust .
but , dude , you 're so lucky . get to stay home at night with the woman you love .
i guess i be lucky .
hey , how 's the mommy-to-be ?
i feel you . i 've be date multiple woman .
you sure you do n't want to come watch game of throne with u ?
oh , that sound great , a bed to yourself . ca n't even remember what that 's like .
be you up-to-date on game of throne ?
mm , i think so . dragon , snow zombie , and all the hot guy be dead .
oh , i do n't know . theon greyjoy look pretty good for a guy who have his genitals cut off .
uh-oh , somebody 's still pout .
leave me alone .
if it 's because you lose a stick , i know where it go .
not funny .
you know you 're gon na make up with him . can we just skip to that part ?
really ? the only adult ?
yeah , that 's right .
tonight i 'll be watch a show rat m.a , and that stand for mature audience , buster .
all right , you would think the only adult would n't let something silly ruin our entire night .
all this could be avoid if you 'd just come to the meeting .
oh , it 's just a meeting . one simple meeting .
stop say meeting .
meeting , meeting , bo-beeting , banana-fana , fo-feeting , fee-fi mo-meeting .
yeah , amy , just one second . meeting .
there you go again .
i 'm sorry , have i be complain about it too much ?
actually , what you 're do be pretend to complain , but really try to brag .
how could you say that ?
i never say that .
do n't you hate it when you ca n't remember whose bra it be you found wedge in your couch ?
oh , he 's all bent out of shape about have a roommate agreement meeting .
apparently , perfect attendance be n't cool any more .
well , i get why he 's annoyed .
well , then you do n't understand what 's happen . see , leonard refuse to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting . this be what a generation raise on bart simpson look like .
you love the simpson .
i love lisa simpson .
well , i know how he feel . i never enjoy our relationship agreement meeting .
wait . you be pretend ?
sorry .
no . i do n't believe you . i could tell .
oh , sheldon , i never thought re-filing a matter in a stand subcommittee could be so fascinate .
hmm , what do you think ?
you do n't know ?
hey , do i say something to upset you ?
no , i 'm fine .
really ? because usually we walk side by side , and i just go up two flight of stair star at your bottom .
just drop it .
okay , i think i see what 's happen here . you 're jealous of me .
oh , please . what could you possibly have that i would be jealous of ?
it 's not what i have , it 's how many people i 'm have it with .
come on , sheldon , we 'll watch game of throne over here .
gladly .
oh , good , go . you know , it 'll be nice to watch an episode without someone say , i read the book , do n't get too fond of this character .
leonard 's be a jerk , so we 're gon na watch over here .
do you guy want to watch with u ?
a long a i do n't have to watch with him .
fine , i do n't want to watch with you either . i 'll go over here .
why do you get to pick ?
okay , then you go there .
howard , just come in here .
wait , do amy make her spinach dip ?
she do .
and i 'm gon na eat it all .
so what the hell happen ?
oh , i just ran out of patience with sheldon 's nonsense .
tell me about it . i 've have it with raj , too .
you know , like woman , men have a monthly hormone cycle . dip in testosterone can cause irritability .
interest . maybe my male cycle sync up with raj 's actual period .
if sheldon 's testosterone dipped , he 'd become a butterfly . oh . maybe someone 's here to apologize .
stuart .
no .
no .
yeah .
say i be talk too much about date claire and emily , and i accuse him of be jealous .
i do n't know how you put up with it . he 's impossible . i mean , hold a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy .
yeah . cap ' n crunch with crunch berry , move on .
anyway , amy , thank you for stick up for me .
oh , i honestly could n't care less .
sorry ?
well , i just take your side 'cause sometimes i get annoyed at how close sheldon and penny be .
who 's always comfort him when he 's upset ?
penny , but
who 's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he 's sick ?
i try to hide it in his peanut butter , but he spit it out .
son of a bitch . why be that funny ?
i do n't know . i like the pain of others .
oh , well , then you 'll enjoy this . bernadette do the same thing with you and koothrappali .
no , she do n't .
she defends him all the time .
she do not .
who told you to stop make all those gandhi joke about him ?
well , she do . and human resource .
who do you think told koothrappali to go to human resource ?
son of a bitch .
you 're , you 're right , it feel good .
all right , it 's almost game time . get it ? game of throne , game time ?
oh , perhaps it 's amy come to her sens .
what 's up ?
you know , you do n't need to use sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement .
from amy .
because you be defend sheldon like you always do .
i do n't always defend sheldon .
oh , yes , you do . you know you have a weird brother-sister-elliott-e.t . relationship with him .
what about your weird relationship with him ?
that 's different . i 'm like the little girl in poltergeist and he 's the creepy thing in the tv .
um , guy ? be there any nut in that food ?
it just say italian sub . i have no idea mortadella have pistachio in it .
interest fact , in italian , the morta in mortadella mean death .
sheldon .
i do n't say fun fact . i 'm not a monster .
now it 's a fun fact .
you know , if you think about it , tonight be kind of like a real-life game of throne .
how ?
well , howard eat that pistachio be like when king joffrey get poison .
okay , well , that be murder , this be an accident .
okay . but you use sheldon to do your dirty work be like when cersei use the king 's guard to do her bidding .
cersei us her body to manipulate men . penny just take me to the lego store .
okay . oh , how about this ? stuart 's dress like a brother of the night 's watch , and they do n't have sex .
there you go .
that 's true .
fair enough .
hey .
hey .
i 'm fine . just a little embarrass i have to be carry down the stair like a baby . thanks .
let 's get out of here .
that be scary .
well , the important thing be i say that big sandwich would ruin everything , and i be right .
hey , jon snow . how come your horse have a basket on it ?
they do n't wear bicycle helmet in game of throne . you 're thematically inaccurate , but i applaud your commitment to safety .
leonard . leonard . leonard .
i never get to ask my question about batman .
what be it ?
if batman be bitten by a radioactive man-bat , and then fought crime disguise a man-bat , would he be man-bat-man-bat-man or simply man-bat-man-bat-batman ?
be he still wear the batman suit under the man-bat suit ?
i 'll be back .
oh , hey , if you guy be free this weekend , i won a night of wine taste from work .
that sound fun .
mm-hmm .
how come scientist do n't win free stuff like salesperson do ?
‘ cause we 're not in it for the stuff . we 're in it for the groupie .
personally , i find the notion of external reward demean . i pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery .
i also say do n't contradict me in front of my friend , but that you do n't remember .
all right , well , let me know if you guy want to go .
i would love to . i do enjoy the complexity of an age pinot noir .
i 'm sure that would pair nicely with your fry nugget of chicken .
wine again ? yeah , no , thank you . i like my grape the old-fashioned way , in a juice box .
well , i 'm go . you could n't stop me from get a massage at the mall , and you 're not stop me now .
i should n't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man .
and i should n't have to see my boyfriend rid on a train for child around the mall .
the little choo-choo for toddler ?
and now you know why i need the massage .
well , we 're out . bernie ca n't drink 'cause she 's pregnant . and she 's pregnant because we have sex . and we have sex because , well , come on .
you sure ?
yeah , give her a break from , well , come on .
well , bernadette , look like saturday night , it 's you and me .
oh , come on . roller coaster , caffeine , runny egg , i 've be avoid these thing all my life . and now , because you 're pregnant , you have to .

i have to admit , i 've be worried about the military application since we start talk about this .

uh , it 's tonight , but it 's first-come , first-served , so we should probably get there early and wait in line .
let 's do it .
penny 's busy with my mother , so i 'm in .
oh , bad news . amy 's make me go shopping with her later , so look like none of u can go .
you do realize we 're allow to have fun without you ?
in fact , that 's usually the trick to it . what time do we need to get there ?
uh , i 'd say by three .
you 're really go without me ?
you do n't have the authority to save place in the line . if i do that , i 'll be cut .
people do it all the time .
you know the golden rule of line etiquette . no cut , no buts , no coconut .
if you really care that much , there be apps now that 'll let you hire people to do stuff like errand and wait in line .
some of these guy make over $ _ an hour .
wow . do n't even make it out of the parking lot . uh , you know what , enough about leonard . let 's talk about you . what would you like to do while you 're here ?
well , i 'd actually like for u to be close , but maybe we start with our favourite book and work our way up to my husband 's sex organ .
uh , for starter , maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything i say ?
uncomfortable .
oh . sorry . do n't know you make those . hey , listen , what if we have a little mother-in-law , daughter-in-law dinner tonight ?
or i invite a few girlfriend , 'cause hearing you say the two of u just sent a chill right down my spine .
what be you do here ? you 're not sheldon .
hold on . he paid you to get out of spending time with me ?
can you understand why i might be annoyed right now ?
we 've wait in a lot of line together , have n't we ?
remember when we camped out for the doctor who panel at comic-con ?
yeah , sleep under the star with other fan who love the show a much a we do .
wake up , wonder which one of those fan stole our wallet .
stuart , what be you do here ?
i do n't understand . you be happy to do this when i hire you . why , why be you upset with me now ?
well , i suppose turnabout be fair play .
i 'm sorry , i 've be go on and on .
i call him babe once . he ask me to get a drug test .
thank you .
you know , she 's my mother-in-law . why ca n't i bond with her like that ?
do you realize it take me five year to get a massage from him ?
three minute . and he use a kitchen timer . i felt like a soft-boiled egg .
you know , be in a relationship with leonard also come with it challenge .
maybe it 's sheldon , here to say he 's sorry .
bernadette , i 'll give you five dollar to slam the door .
boy , all this stand 's make me tire . good thing i brought my collapsible stick chair .
stick and stone may break my bone , but chair on stick be comfy .
do you make the apology a sincere a i would have ?

what if every person in front of u let someone cut ?
we 'd still get in .
what if each of those people let someone cut ?
still get in .
but then each of those people let someone cut ?
we 'd still get in , but first i 'd hit you over the head with his stick chair .
excuse me .
oh , please do n't .
uh , uh , i could n't help but notice that you cut the line .
you need to go to the back of the line .
mr wunch in fourth grade . and my slogan be a line that 's straight be a line that 's great .
boy , i wish i could say no .
well , he 's come a long way . or a short way very slowly , so it feel like a long way .

okay , you know what ? this be ridiculous . i 've be try to make a connection with you all day , and clearly i 'm get nowhere .
what i be seek be some sort of friendship . but at this point , i 'll take you not insult me to my face .
okay , good example .
what about joss whedon 's work make you think he 'd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters ?

he 's get him there . the d even stand for department .
excuse me , excuse me , can i please see a show of hand ? who here take issue with this person cut the line ?
well , what a sad state of affair . that you 've all be so ground down by life , you do n't even notice when someone disrespect you .
i ca n't believe we 're gon na get beat up , and it 's not because of your chair .
i most certainly do not .
no , i ca n't . this be n't right .
you do everything you could .
no , i could 've do more .
now , now , you denigrate the memory of a great civil right pioneer . that 's all anyone could ask .
i know how you feel . she do n't invite any of u .
it be spur of the moment .
thank you . so if we would have ask you to come to vega to see u get married , you would 've come ?
you really think we make a mistake ?
wow . okay . well , um , how about this ? maybe while you 're still in town , leonard and i could have another small ceremony . you know , if you 're interested .
she would find it perfectly acceptable . you guy saw it . we bond .
hi , how be the screen ?
oh , sheldon invoked rosa park to make somebody who cut the line feel bad , but only the white people felt bad .
ugh , i should 've never bought him that colour book that explains black history month .
uh , you know , it start a little rocky , but i think we get to a good place .
wow . well do .
yeah , and when i drop her off at the hotel , she even give me a hug .
do she think you be choke or i 'm sorry , that 's great . thank you for spending time with her .
no problem . um , so listen , i do n't know if you have any plan next weekend , but i kind of promise your mom we 'd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time .
yeah , kind of , but now we can invite our friend and family .
seem like a lot of trouble for a hug .
come on , it 'll be fun , and , you know , your mom be genuinely hurt we do n't invite her to the first one .
look , in our defence , it be kind of a spur of the moment thing , and also , we do n't like her .
leonard , come on , she 's your mom . if we can do something to make her happy , why would n't we ?
i just say why , we do n't like her .
hey , look , then forget about her , let 's do it for u . we could keep it small and informal . this time we can invite our family .
be your brother out of prison ?
i 'd love it if my dad could come .
oh , you have to invite him . i have n't see him since the divorce .
oh , he 's like a different man . he stop twitch , and i think he grow an inch and a half .
well , then it 's settle . yay . so funny . i never thought my second marriage would be to you .
okay , so it 's not a legal ceremony , it 's just a chance for u to redo our vow so everyone can be part of it .
so there 's no maid of honour ?
no .
huh . but if i be to , say , wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you , you would n't be able to stop me , right ?
i do n't see how i could .

you can never be too careful . i get one last year before i go to epcot .
oh , it 's good . i just wish leonard would work up the courage to tell sheldon he 's move in here .

fine , i guess . i 've be focus on me . i be think about change my wardrobe .

of course . all we need be to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this .
exactly . i 'll bet there 's something around here that could be a lever .
let 's see , a lever , a lever .
thanks a lot , guy .
it 's not funny . you 're up . call your mother .
oh , maybe later . your pig die make me sad . and a little hungry .
phone , now .
try dial .
what make you say that ?
there 's get ta be something else we could try .
if this be star trek , we could use a phaser to blast it off .
no , it 's too broad of a beam . you 'd need something more precise , like superman 's heat vision .
ooh , the green lantern 's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it .
if you need a green hand , why not just use the hulk ?
oh , please , the hulk would never get across the border with that temper .
guy , excuse me , not that call one of the avenger be n't a perfectly reasonable choice , but we 're scientist . do n't you think we can figure this out use actual science ?
yes , we could use science . but it 's your bachelor party . lighten up .
we will , we will percussive shock you .
we will , we will percussive shock you .
they 're basically pure hydrocarbon soak in fat . let 's hope the lug nut expands .
what if that burning food attracts animal ?
we have plenty of food for the animal .
we do ?
yep . a six-foot wiener in a flash t-shirt .
it 's a bachelor party . lighten up .
it 's burning salsa . i 'm hop the acidity and salinity combine with electricity will corrode the lug nut off .
what an innovative solution . perhaps i do n't give your mit education enough credit .
yeah , i saw it on mythbusters .
all right , this rust , combine with the aluminium recover from the van , be now thermite .
great . couple of pinch ought to do the trick .
be that enough to melt the lug nut ?
well , let 's start small . we can always add more .
you put up a good fight , lug nut , but you 've met your match .
hey , look , the lug nut 's off .
what ? what be you do back ?
we get a flat and could n't get the tyre off .
oh , i 'm sorry .
thank you .
if it make you feel any well , i pierce amy 's ear and her mom make her sit in my closet .

thank you for let me come speak with you .
a my relationship with penny and amy be currently strain , i 'm turn to you for female comfort and encouragement .
yeah , i know , top ten , pretty excite .
well , in addition to amy leave me , leonard 's move in with penny . it 's difficult not to feel abandon .
perhaps i could find someone well than leonard . someone i can rub in his face . chris pratt 's all the rage right now . i wonder how he 'd feel about take the small bedroom .
gandalf , but he 's a smoker .
have you see this archie comic ? it 's actually archie versus predator .
how could archie defeat predator ?
i do n't know . maybe jughead 's a terminator .
hey , stuart .
why ?
what kind of music be you think of ?
hey , we 've always talk about play together .
oh , we could play filk music .
it 's be around for year . it 's like folk music , but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme .
dude , if we do this , we 're gon na need a cool band name .
you know , i 've actually have one i 've be sit on for year .

do i really have to do that now ?
it 's harder than i thought .
let me help you . l e o n .
that help .
so i have an idea for a filk song . it 's kind of a , a power ballad , superhero crossover tale of epic proportion .
be it cold in here , 'cause , oh , my .
okay , so it 's a , it 's a david and goliath story . it 's about man against god . it 's call hammer and whip , the untold story of thor versus indiana jones .
thor versus indiana jones ? you just blew my filking mind .
that be , that be so good !
right ? mamma-jamma just come to me .
okay , and here 's the hook . thor and dr jones . thor and dr jones . one play with lightning , the other play with bone .
oh , man , that rock .
hey , remember the ark of the covenant ?
yeah ?
it say here you 're a chemist . which element on the periodic table do you feel be too big for it britches ?
in general , would you say that you smell well , bad or the same a you do right now ?
i 'm not gon na be your roommate , sheldon .
but i met with _ people , and they all walk out . and that hollywood phoney chris pratt never tweet me back .
i 'm sure you 'll find somebody else .
they do n't use to be . you and leonard and penny , you all poison me with emotion . i be like the tin man , perfectly content until that evil wizard give him a heart .
i do n't think that be the point of the movie .
fine , then i be like pinocchio before that jerk geppetto go and make him a real boy .
there you go .
so , what be you think for dinner ?
well , it 's thai food night .
well , honey , you do n't live with sheldon any more . you can have anything you want .

how about thai food ?
oh , thank god .
hey , we 're go to dinner . you want to come ?
hang on . wait , you actually think it 's _ ?
i guess . i 'm just , you know , worried about sheldon .
well , come on , he 's a grown man in his 30 pretend to be a grown man in his 20 . he 's fine .
what else can you do ? move back in with him ?
no , of course not . i just feel bad .
trust me , this be the right thing .
i know . and it 's not like we 're abandon him . plus , we can facetime him whenever we want , you know , once iphones be invent in his universe .
i ca n't believe he ran my credit .
you really should 've go on the internet and checked how long that kind of thing life before you get one .
hey , i know sheldon 's quirky , but he 's also brilliant and insightful . i think call him a weirdo be a little unfair .
hey , we brought you thai . where be everything ?
in my present , it 's in the future . in your present , it 's be crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man i met in the home depot parking lot .
i know what you 're do . you 're try to get attention so we 'll feel bad for you , but it 's not happen .
no , what i 'm do be try to figure out how to live my life now that everyone be leave me .

yeah , so what ?
you be such a wimp . she do n't like it , now you do n't like it .

the past be lunch . you know what 's really happen here ? your girlfriend be break up our band .
she have nothing to do with this . i be my own man .
that be so not true .
really ? remember when you be gon na get circumcise for rachel bernstein ?
that have nothing to do with rachel . it be an overreaction to a bad zipper injury .
i do n't need this . i 'm quit the band .
fine , i quit , too .
then get out of my house .
with pleasure .
raj , wait .
buddy , i know me move in with penny feel like a big change , but it 's not .

that 'll teach her to care about your health .
yeah , i ca n't wait to see the look on her face when i die young .
the other day , when she try to put that fitbit on me and i ran away from her .
accord to a recent study , simply think about exercise , even while sit still , can have physical benefit . for all you know , i could be exercise right now .
be you ?
nah , i 'll do it tomorrow .
it would n't be the bad thing if we be more active .
you make an excellent point . ooh , i think i 'm get a runner 's high .
look at all these activity the university have . rock climb club , archery , flag football .
have me at flag , lose me at football .
yeah , i think it 's great you guy want to get more exercise , but do you really think sport be the right choice for you ?
what be you say ? we 're not coordinate enough to play sport ?
okay , leonard , sweetheart , you twist your ankle play scrabble .
it 's indoors , so no sunscreen .
no throw , no catch , no run .
preach .
and a an add bonus , the word touche come from fence . it would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense .
what about a game of tag on a french schoolyard ?
all right , well , what have you try so far ?
i feel cool . like pus in boot .
i always want to be a swashbuckler when i be a kid .
technically , swashbuckler be a combination of two term . swash refer to the sound of the sword . swash . and then buckler meaning a small shield , which you do n't have .
well say , pus .
yeah , i 'm here because i think it 's gon na be like game of throne .

right . always right .
he 's a righty .
oh , god , i be go to feel this tomorrow .
excuse me , barry ?
when can i stab one of my friend ?
hey , have you read the online review for this place ?
look at u . we 're like the rockettes .
en garde , leonard . prepare yourself for a rigorous touch .
my name be inigo montoya . you kill my father . prepare to die .
my name be inigo montoya . you kill my father . prepare to die .
i thought you be pus in boot .
oh , yeah , right . sorry . my name be pus in boot . you kill my father . prepare to die .
i 'm look forward to him teach u glove-slapping .
what ?
you know , when my honour be insult , and i need to challenge someone to a duel by slap them across the face with my glove .
when be your honour insult ?
my last physical .
again , that doctor do n't insult your honour . just checked your prostate .
my name be little orphan annie . you kill my father . prepare to die .
my name be darth vader . i be your father . prepare to die .
ah , this be fun .
well , good . it 's nice to see your mind off amy .
not that it 's any of your business , but she broke up with me .
oh . i hate to say it , but it sound like he 's interested in her .
well , that 's unacceptable .
oh , buddy , i get that you do n't like it , but it 's not really up to you .
yeah , but he 's dumb , and his face be dumb .
look , even if it 's not him , amy 's probably go to date someone at some point .
you really think so ?
of course . she deserves to be happy .
how dare you .
listen , i should warn you that maybe ask amy out be n't a good idea .
barry , a word ?
and now the crazy version of what i just say .
if you intend to pursue amy , you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it .
by challenge you to a duel .
yeah .
well , you 're talk to u now . i mean , you do n't seem nervous .
do you not hear how creepy that sound ?
okay . do n't be offend , but , what go wrong with you ?
suddenly , the rabbit thing make sense .
i 'm surprised you want to go to a sport bar , sheldon .
look at this blister . like it or not , we 're athlete now . besides , a bar be where i belong . i 'm have female problem .
if you 're cranky and retain water , i have a theory .
sheldon , instead of focus on amy date other guy , maybe you should start think about date another girl .
that 's ridiculous .
true , but penny 's married , and so be bernadette . and your girlfriend have red hair and white skin , which really rub up against my clown phobia .
maybe you should consider woman who be n't in serious relationship with your closest friend ?
there 's that prostate doctor , but i 'm still mad at her . oh , there 's a woman . i 'll make her my girlfriend .
you 're forget something . lady love jock .
how many sip of that beer do he have ?
three .
oh , boy .
excuse me . i 'm recover from a recent breakup , and i 'm told ask out another woman might make me feel well . and a ash ketchum say to pikachu , i choose you .
it 's a pokemon reference .
well , we give it a shot . how about you ?
ah , what might have be . and you , give my regard to barnum and bailey .
well , he knew he be on the breast cam .
i do n't have much experience turn men down . it be n't so much fun .
and sometimes we marry them anyway .
huh . well , this be weird .
what ?
barry kripke just ask me out .
i told you thing would change if you plucked your eyebrow .
hi , how be you ? i be wonder if you 'd like to get a drink after work sometime .
well , what be you gon na do ?
i do n't know . i guess i assume that i would eventually date other people , but this be happen so fast .
well , i be hop the next person i date would be a little less like sheldon .
i think she mean not a weirdo .
i do n't know .
all right , well , what happens if you imagine him naked ?
oh , i do n't have to imagine it .
i smell funny . i taste salty .
you 're just sweaty from exercise .
and kind of delicious . i wonder how many lick it would take to get to the centre of me .
i know it only take one doctor 's finger .
hello .
hello .
we should let you guy talk .
look at me go .
how have you be ?
i 'm do all right . i try fence today .
how 'd that go ?
it be pretty easy . and i think my background in mathletics help . barry kripke be there . i should let you know that he express interest in ask you out .
well , actually , he , he already do .
okay . but do n't get too attach to him . in two year , _ day , he 's a dead man .
i say no .
interest . i ask two woman out today , and they both say no .
i do n't know you be interested in date .
i 've be told it 's a good way to move on .
oh . okay . anyway , um , it 's nice to see you . you look good .
thanks . and i taste good too .
what 's up ?
what 's go on ?
before i tell you , perhaps i should soften the blow . you 're face be pleasingly symmetrical .
just tell me .
a swedish team of physicist be try to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment .
oh , well , that kind of stink .
what be we go to do ?
perform the experiment immediately .
i 'd love to , but we need liquid helium and our shipment 's on back order for a month .
a month ? what ? be you kid me ? that would have be a good time for you to soften the blow .
that shirt brings out the blue in your eye .
thank you . be n't you sweet .
let 's go check to see if the university have any helium in reserve .
do you know that i almost do n't wear this shirt today ?
but you wo n't need much for that .
come on , barry , there 's a swedish team try to run our experiment before u . ca n't you spare any ?
yes .
what be you do ?
he say be honest , so i be honest . do n't your mother tell you ? it 's the best policy . so , what do you say ?
he could 've soften the blow .
why do you need kripke ? ca n't you just go to party city for helium ?
we 'd have to go to every party city in california .
hey , people be still talk about that party on siete de mayo .
leonard , if that swedish team beat u , i will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again . which be a shame , because swedish meatball be my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball .
if you need liquid helium so bad , i know a guy who can get you some , if you do n't ask too many question .
where do he work ?
how do he get the helium ?
how many question be too many question ?
maybe he 's not for you .
four question . there answer 's four .
oh , good for him .
so be she , like , homeless , or frame him for a crime ?
oh , which one ? maybe we can get amy to try it .
wow . so how many girl have you met ?
well , so how do it work ?
what 's he say ?
he 's get what we need and can meet u tonight .
that 's right . and what do he do ?
it 's like it be yesterday .
do you want liquid helium or not ?
of course i do . i do n't want that swedish team scoop u .
then i 'm go to tell him we 're in .
leonard , wait . this be highly unethical .
sure . so , be we do this ?
well , but where do he get the helium ?
uh , but this be violate university code .
a little , but if i may quote einstein , the pursuit of science call u to ignore the rule set by man .
huh . all right , do it . tell him we 're in .
do .
i ca n't find that quote on the internet . do you make that up ?
before i answer , may i just say your skin have never look well .
be n't you just make of sugar .
i 'm not sure how i feel about this .
oh , come on , just let him put the app on your phone .
okay , let me see . nope , nope , nope , oh , he 's cute .
and he 's sad about it .
hey .
hello .
hey .
if you want me to stay out later , you should 've give me more spending money .
oh , fun . let me see . uh , no , no , uh , definitely not .
what be wrong with that guy ?
uh , he 's indian . we 've already get one of those . ooh , we should find a nice latino , really round u out .
hey , i want to try .
uh , excuse me , can i have my phone back ?
hang on , i 'm try to find you the next great love of your life . the man who will father your child . okay , yes or no on white guy with dreadlock ?
that must be him .
hey .
uh , i 'm leonard . this be my friend
uh , yeah , uh , right here .
wait , hold on , hold on . how do we know that you 're not gon na take the money and drive away ?
exactly what 1970s television crime drama have taught u . you give u the helium first .
guess i 'm not the only one who watch '70s television crime drama .
look , you can trust u . we 're respect scientist .
well , i never thought of it like that . boy , frame of reference will just sneak up on you , wo n't it ?
my friend do make a decent point about the money . i do n't feel comfortable just hand it over up front .
i do n't think it matter if this be a stalemate or an impasse or a mexican standoff . what be we gon na do here ?
yeah , exactly . see , you 're get it .
perfect . now we really be in a mexican standoff . be this one of those time where i 've won the battle but lose the war ?
all right , let 's all just calm down . nobody want to report anybody .
no , no , no . wait , do n't go . just let me explain . we 're physicist , and we 're try to prove a hypothesis that we 've be work on for over a year .
space-time can be interpret a the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid .
okay , but now there 's this swedish team that read our paper and they 're try to beat u to our own discovery . we really need this helium .
and i 'm sorry i lie about be a wedding planner who ca n't find love . although i be currently single , if you know anybody .
it 's actually pretty common in our field . there 's not much you can do about it .
do you hear that , leonard ? there 's plenty we could do about it . do you have a card ?
you know he wo n't be look at other girl .
unless they 're sit on the end of his nose .
okay , okay , okay . thumb down . next .
well if he 's good in bed , she can throw him a fish .
i love you , amy .
look , it 's stuart .
you may want to leave the room .
right this way , uncle harvey .
i 'm try not to attract attention .
and tip his hat to the cleaning lady do n't do that ?
she say buenas noches . what be he suppose to do ?
let 's just start the experiment .
leonard , we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught .
we 're not get caught .
uh-oh .
what ?
well , do you see this sticker ?
it 's partially torn off , but the segment that remains read property of and the letter u .
it 's probably usc or ucla .
yeah , but what if it 's property of u.s government ? there 's a national helium reserve in amarillo , texas . if this be steal from there , we 're accessory to a federal crime .
let 's not jump to conclusion . a lot of thing start with u .
that 's true . there 's the u.s air force , u.s department of defence , u.s navy , you and i be go to jail .
listen , we can do the experiment a plan and beat the swedish team to the punch , or we can kiss our dream good-bye because we be to afraid to break a few rule .
ma'am .
okay , do everyone remember the rule ? if he 's shirtless , one sip . pose with a pet , two sip . pet and shirtless , chug like it 's your job . and pull .
i have that same underwear .
chug .
amy , you 're get a text .
oh , um , give me that .
i have a great time last night .
you go on a date last night ? be you see someone ?
okay , it 's like that .
anyway , if you could just give u our money back , you can have your helium and we 'll be on our way .
no , nothing . we just change our mind .
thank you .
you 're take advantage of u ? we clarify nomenclature together .
you know what ? it 's fine . keep the money . we just want to be do with this .
i do n't understand .
he want more money .
i ca n't believe you 're see someone and we do n't even know about it .
amy .
it 's go fine . it 's mostly just be meeting people for coffee .
well , i do n't have much experience date , so i decide it would be good for me to , you know , get out there a little .
well , good for you .

fine , i 'll leave . but it sound like somebody need a fresh diaper .
all right , i admit that i do n't help out a lot . and i need to work on that . but if we have a kid , it would be different .
because when my dad left , i promise myself that if i ever have a chance to be a father i 'd always be there .

oh , i do n't want credit for that .
oh , dr and mr hofstadter , lovely to see you this fine morning .
yeah , i be indeed . i have decide , instead of wallow in sadness about amy , it be time that i find myself a new female companion .
oh . good for you .
what brought this on ?
i realize something . when amy be in my life , i be hyper-focused on my work and ignore her .
and you do n't want to make the same mistake with the next woman .
no , i need a new woman in my life to ignore so i can hyper-focus on my work again .
hey , i make french toast stick .
on oatmeal day ?
ah , i also make oatmeal .
ooh , that 's a lot of carbohydrate for a man on the prowl . you know what ? you eat it . you 're married , it do n't matter what you look like .
do n't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow .
thank you for come by , gentleman .
no problem .
so what 's up ?
well , it be the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me . now that i 'm look for my next girlfriend , it seem only logical that i employ your service once again .
you sure you 're up for that ? she do hurt you .
you 're not wrong about fruit stripe . i be always a hubba bubba man .
hubba bubba over dubble bubble ? you 're crazy .
gentleman .
oh , right , uh , girlfriend . okay .
but what be you look for ?
all right , fine , she do n't need her own point of view . now , chop-chop .
come on , amy , show u the dress .
okay . but i 'm really step outside of my comfort zone here .

no one ever bought me drink at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt .
do you have any heel high than this ? he 's pretty tall .

to that new italian place on walnut .
i 'm gon na go look for other shoe .
good luck . i threw out all my tall one when i married leonard .
we do n't even know what time they 're gon na be there .
damn , you 're sneaky .
i think the quick way to find you a new girlfriend be just to get you on every date web site out there .
be you sure ? i 've heard that on those site , often when you think you 're correspond with someone , it 's actually a computer program pretend to be a real person .
and you 're afraid it 'll do a well job than you ?
excuse me . no one do a well job pretend to be a person than i do . siri come close , but i know more joke .
if you do n't want to use date web site , what do you suggest ?
people compete for job and trophy , why not me ?
he 's right , he know a lot of joke .
yeah , no , but it be basic human nature . if we present him a a prize , maybe they would .
well , he 's smart , he 's a respect scientist .
and i have the soulful eye of a cow .
i have an idea . what if we put a post on craigslist that say world-class caltech physicist seek girlfriend . if interested , solve the follow puzzle for a chance to meet him .
oh , we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle give the winner sheldon 's contact information .
well , this be actually an interest social experiment .
i 'm a little jealous of the people who get to do it .
me , too . and we 've see the prize .
i do n't understand why we 're leave so early for the movie .
oh , i forgot to tell you , we 're gon na meet up with bernadette to spy on amy and her date .
what ? i do n't want to do that .
what , and you think i want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycle ?
this be the movie that big soda do n't want you to see .
no , it 's the movie your wife do n't want you to see .
so you 're actually okay with invade your friend 's privacy ?
you 're not curious who she 's out with ?
not really .
but you 're curious about aluminium can ? you 're a weird little guy .
that 's it . the sheldon cooper girlfriend challenge be officially live .
congratulation .
this be excite .
right now , somewhere , a woman be divide the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colour in the old national flag still in use .
then use that number a the average speed to calculate the travel time from mordor to the shire .
and , take her first step towards a lifetime of laughter , love and , best of all , rule .
i , i hope we do n't make the puzzle too hard .
well , if she can solve them , it 'll prove she 's intelligent , tenacious and so socially awkward she have nothing well to do on a saturday night .
golly , she sound too good to be true .
well , i 'm have a good time , too . if you do n't mind me ask , why do you and your wife split up ?
oh , i 'm , i 'm so sorry .
