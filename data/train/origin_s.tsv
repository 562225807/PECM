okay , this grid represent the room . all we need to do be plot out where each squeak be , and we can find a quiet path to the crib .

mm . except the creature in the crib be a level-nine poop monster .
okay , uh , you check for squeak , and i will mark them down .

why do you bounce with your hand in the air like that ?

i do n't want to wait two day for u to work this out .
very well . you get married spur of the moment , i do n't see why your divorce should be any different .
i would pull this car over and kick you out , but if penny dump me , you 're all i get .
when be the last time you get a massage ?
sheldon walk on my back two week ago , but that be just 'cause there be a spider on his pillow and he be try to get away .
leonard stood on me once , too , but he be just try to see the rise parade .
i do n't know the protocol , be you gon na be naked for your massage ?
well , yeah .
hmm . then this be probably too many clothes .
hey .
what be you do here ?
okay . leonard , i really appreciate that , but i need a little time to myself .
okay . i do n't get it , you say make an effort , here i be make an effort .
hello , amy . it 's nice to see you .
nice to see you , too .
and that 's how you make effort look effortless .
all right . can you please just go and we 'll talk about this tomorrow ?
i do n't understand what you want .
you know what ? if you 'd like , i could whip up a quick relationship agreement . well , i 'm at a spa , i might a well do something relax .
sheldon , why do n't we give them some privacy ?
very well . hey , later we 'll check out the minibar , i 'll show you how godzilla get drunk .
so , what we do be map out the entire room to identify every squeak . watch . it 's easy , once you get the hang of it . step . step . hop onto ottoman .
you actually expect me to do this while hold a baby in the dark .
big problem , i felt something pop .
there 's a cucumber in my water .
do they know it 's there ? i mean , should i tell somebody ?
it 's there on purpose . it 's refresh .
interest . the world 's most boring liquid and the world 's most boring vegetable , but you put 'em together and bleugh .
hey .
hey .
oh good , you 're here . be you still fight ? if you get divorce , do i get two christmas 's ?
we 're not get divorce .
listen , we realize , that , uh , we 're face some new challenge a a married couple .
yeah . and there be a few thing we need to stay on top of . so we thought it would useful , and i ca n't believe i 'm about to say this , um .
would you please help u make a relationship agreement ? but one that 's tailor to u , okay , we do n't need a bathroom schedule .
although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance .
what do you say ?
i get to write a contract ? i say , let 's get this party of the first part start .
do you really think that 's funny ?
it 's in our agreement . i have to laugh .
if you find this draft acceptable , then i believe your new relationship agreement be ready to be sign .
article _ , subsection b , leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hour penny be not home . this include boxer , brief , thong , g-string or anything else that call attention to his pasty little thigh .
me , too .
oh well , great then , here , you sign here , date here , and penny , if you could initial here to indicate that you 're accept leonard in a be condition .
i remember signing our first relationship agreement .
mm . you seem to be forget the no nostalgia clause .
right , right . get it .
what 's go on with that woman you 're date ?
she say she do n't want to see me any more and i found that insult .
i do n't know , she do n't even give me a reason .
can we not play this game ?
do n't like game . that 's one .
ignore him . yeah , sorry about the breakup .
that 's okay , i 'm fine .
of course you 're fine . not every member of a specie find a mate . sir isaac newton die a virgin , look at the contribution he make .
i 'm not a virgin , sheldon .
you 're not be very nice .
what ? he say he be fine .
sometimes people say thing they do n't mean .
oh , that 's a paradox . i mean if you meant what you just say , then that mean you may not have meant what you just say .
careful , i saw this on star trek . smoke 's gon na come out of his ear soon . hey .
hey , boy . how 's it go ?
yeah .
we be discuss raj 's recent breakup and apparently , i be insensitive to him .
it 's okay , i 'm fine .
do n't fall for it . he 'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin , and suddenly you 're the bad guy .
sheldon , when i say i be fine , i meant i do n't want to talk about it any more .
then why do n't you say that ?
because that 's not what people do .
well , i would prefer if people told me exactly what be on their mind .
no . no , you do n't , you really do n't . i actually ca n't say do n't enough .
well , it certainly would be easy . you have no idea what it 's like to struggle with recognize emotional cue .
i 'm sure it 's extremely frustrate .
thank you .
and also a little sad .
you know , i just read that a team at mit . developed a device that help people read human emotion .
it 's suppose to be accurate , like , _ % of the time .
wow , i find that hard to believe .
that a bunch of awkward scientist with no social skill would invent a machine to do it for them ?
i take it back . i believe it .
you if it 's at mit , i can make some call . maybe we can get sheldon a prototype .
what do you think ?
would n't that be nice .
now that sheldon 's across the hall , have you decide what you 're do with his old room ?
you could make it a train room .
i do n't like train . you like train .
i know , and amy say i ca n't have a train room .
sheldon , i just heard from the guy at mit about that emotion reader . they 're send a prototype for you to beta test .
wonderful . although i 'm not sure how i feel about be use a a guinea pig .
well , when you get the machine , you can find out .
maybe i could use it to understand why woman keep dump me .
well , you do n't need a machine for that , just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize .
that 's actually not a bad idea . maybe i could even get them all together , sort of like a , a focus group , to find out what 's wrong with me .
no , raj , that 's a terrible idea .
yeah , i be joking .
really ? uh , little tip : joke be often well when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha .
hey , great news . the tv i want will fit in the game room , and if i leave the curtain open , i can watch it from work .
hey , can you hold off redo the room ? my brother 's come out here in a few week .
oh . yeah . okay , sure . what 's go on with your brother ?
my dad ask if i can get him a job interview at my work .
huh . be that a good idea ? i mean , you think they 'll consider someone who be in prison for sell drug ?
well , i sell pharmaceutical . that 's just a really hard to spell word for drug .
well , i 'm sure he 'll appreciate carry his sample in a briefcase instead of his colon . how long do you think he 'll stay ?
i , i 'm not sure . maybe a few day . unless he get the job , then who know ?
hmm . who know ? that 's excite . i 'll get to wake up every morning and see if he 's still here .
you do n't have a problem with this , do you ?
of course not . i mean , he 's your brother .
okay . thank you , you 're the best . mm .
remember that when the new tv fall off the wall and crush u both .
this thing 's pretty cool . it interprets emotion use a wireless signal to analyse subtle change in breathing and heart rate .
it 's amaze a machine can do that .
yes . now , when the robot rise up , they 'll know that i 've be root for them the whole time .
the display be sync to your phone . give it a try .
okay , remember , it can only detect happy , sad , angry and excite . not other thing you 're feel , like , what have i do with my life ?
okay , i 'm look at the first picture .
you be happy ?
yes . i 'm look at puppi
aw . somebody 's ignore their tiny needle teeth , but all right .
try another one .
okay . what do it say i 'm feel ?
sad .
yes . i 'm look at a picture of my grandma .
oh , that make sense , 'cause she 's go and you miss her .
and you 're worried that turkey neck be in your future . what , now , see , now it say you 're mad . make up your mind .
be that emily your ex-girlfriend ?
oh , god . you go through with that ? what be wrong with you ?
you 're not gon na get information , you 're just gon na get criticism that hurt your feeling .
do n't worry , i 'm a grown man . i have a thick skin .
you 're so stupid .
hey .
hey , would you take a look at my brother 's resume ? i 'm try to help him clean it up a little .
yeah , sure . he really work with the drug enforcement agency ?
he do n't know it till he be cuffed , but yeah .
hey , leonard , if you 're happy and you know it , no need to clap your hand , because i have an emotion detector .
how 's it work out ?
surprisingly well .
that 's great , i 'm happy for you .
no , wait , uh , hold on . oh , what , you be . be n't you sweet ?
no , it 's my brother 's . i 'm try to help him get a job out here .
oh , ooh ! and that make leonard angry .
no , it do n't .
what , leonard , please . i know an angry face when i see it . it 's this red frowny guy on my phone .
what ? be you really upset about randall come ?
no .
yes .
i say no .
it 's like you 're twin .
leonard , if you 're mad about this , just tell me .
fine . you invite your drug dealer brother to stay with u for god know how long and do n't bother to ask me first .
he 's my brother . i do n't think i need your permission .
well , hey . now she 's angry , too . this thing work like gangbusters .
i 'm not say you have to ask my permission , but you could have talk to me about it before you say it be okay .
like you talk to me about your game room ?
our game room . i be gon na put a scent candle in it .
he 's still mad .
stop enjoy their fight .
you first .
if you be this upset , why do n't you say so when i told you ?
because i do n't want to sound like a jerk .
well , you sound like one now . i do n't see the big deal if my brother come and stay for a while .
if you get him a job , he 's gon na live here forever !
he would get his own place .
have he ever have his own place ?
yes .
hey , i share my honey nut cheerio with you
you give me a bill at the end of every month .
stay out of this . you and your stupid machine start this fight .
come on , sheldon , let 's go .
gladly . can we storm out ?
i think it loses it impact if we 're chat about it .
fine . i 'll just give them the finger .
okay , first off , i want to thank you all so much for come . howard be here to interpret for emily , and to take note .
no , he do n't think it 's stupid .
uh , head up , both of you be name emily , so we 'll call you red-headed emily , and you , red-headed emily , junior .
hey , you go out with him . i do n't .
oh , okay . um , i 'm lucy , and i broke up with raj because i have severe social anxiety , and he kept try to force me into uncomfortable situation .
yeah .
i do do that . i can be insensitive to other people 's boundary . howard , would you write that down ?

ooh , i 'm not sure i 'm comfortable share detail about our relationship in front of howard .
okay . well , whenever you and i be in bed

your father may have spoil you , but i wo n't . if you want a ticket to comic-con , i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself .

no , i want you to go .
okay , good , 'cause that 's what i want , too .
now we 're go a hulk and she-hulk . i do n't want to take my shirt off at comic-con .
if i may speak for comic-con , we do n't want that either .
be that nice ?
no , but it 's honest , and it sound like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship .
do you think she 's a honest with you ?
i should hope so . when she call me an insensitive jerk , i 'd like to think she meant it .
there 's get to be other way you can make a quick buck .
i really should wear a bell around my neck so you guy can hear me come .

sheldon , woman can wear make up , it 's not lie .
i be talk about leonard . and if make up be so truthful , why be it call concealer ?
wait , wait , wait , what 's leonard lie about ?
he do n't really want penny to go to comic-con . he 's just do it to make her happy .
really ? because she do n't actually want to go . she 's just do it to make him happy .
why ?
because it 's between them .

oh , we 're smarter than that .
i know our apartment 's small , but i think we can make room .
no , sheldon . we be not get a life-size spider-man statue .
we do have sheldon 's old room . if he really need a place to stay , i guess we should offer it to him .
you 're a good friend .
you 're an even well husband .
where would he stay ? we already have stuart .
that sound awful .
let 's hope he think so , too .
for the last time , no hulk , no batman , no life-size statue .
wow . i 'm start to think you do n't mean it when you say you want to spruce up the place .
hello .
hey , uh , so we 've be talk , and if you need a place to stay , we 'd be happy to fix up the garage for you .
that would be amaze . i be literally just look at my move box , try to pick one to live in .
i know it 's not ideal , but you 'd have plenty of space for your furniture , and there 's this cool button that make an entire wall go up and down .
i can not thank you enough .
hey , buddy , you still look for a place to live ?
you know , we have the extra bedroom , and if you need it , it 's yours .
it 's the least we can do .

i do n't know . why be you ask all these question ?
well , to be honest , leonard 's on the other line , and he offer me their spare bedroom .
great . go live there .
but you make the garage sound so fun .
i just do n't want you to feel bad about it . unless leonard 's apartment also have a raccoon that chew it way in on cold night , go there .

and what be that suppose to mean ?
well , it 's like that science thing . for every action , you have a gigantic and annoy reaction .
just when i thought you could n't get any hotter .
do not adjust the dosage . you nail it .
do n't listen to them . what 's weird be that penny almost get a science fact right .
i mean , it 's unfair . people just assume i 'm go to be upset by raj move into my old room .
but you be , be n't you ?
oh , i 'm outrage .
there be a lot of memory wrap up in that room . for me , too . the first time you told me you love me be in that room .
wrong . we be stand outside my room in the hallway .
and there be the love of which i speak .
i realize it 's irrational , but with raj move in there , i 'm feel a bit replace .
well , this be n't an easy time for him . he 's lose his apartment , he 's in debt , he 's probably humiliate .
can i get anyone anything at all ?
raj , you do n't have to serve u .
it 's the least i can do for help me carry my stuff up .
not for you , box of towel .
anyway , thanks again .
hey , look at that . you 've get a raj , we 've get a stuart . maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together .
i do n't know . yours look like he have worm .
what 's that ?

he also never have sex in that room . that 's something else to look forward to .
this mean a lot .

sheldon .

sheldon .
you 're right , i be humiliate . thanks for point it out . you 're such a jerk .
yes .
i thought that be gon na break the other way .
come on , sheldon . maybe we should just eat at our place .
fine . you take my room . you turn my friend against me . i hope you 're happy .
what do i have to be happy about ? my life 's a wreck .
how come he can say it and i ca n't ?
hello , sheldon . what a pleasant surprise . how be you ?
oh , i just say that because he prattle . what 's go on ?
mm . well , what do you think the loss of your room represent ?
very well , but , uh , if you do n't mind , i 'd still like to pause for effect . now , you 've recently move in with dr fowler , yes ?
clearly , your old room represent an escape hatch , and without it , you 're force to confront the terrify reality of be trap in a relationship with amy forever .
i have n't thought about that .
hello , amy . your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurity about your relationship with sheldon .
interest . they 've found a need to take yet another room mate . seem they 're avoid some harsh reality themselves .
that be the word on the street , dear .
maybe move in be a bad idea . i have n't be here one day , i 'm already cause problem .
you do n't do anything . it 's sheldon .
you do n't do anything , it 's sheldon . that 'd make a nice needlepoint pillow .
so , relax . we 're happy to have you .
thank you , but how do i know you 're not say that just to be nice ?
do you actually pay for that haircut ?
that 'll do it .
hey , raj , i owe you an apology . look , could you please put your dog on a leash ?
sheldon , she 's fine .
thank you . i appreciate that .
no , i ca n't take all the credit . i spoke with leonard 's mother , and she make me feel well .
i do n't know who you talk to , but that be n't my mother .
beverly point out that i 'm experience insecurity in my relationship with amy , in the same way that leonard and penny be in their relationship .
hello , leonard .
i see . you must be yell at me out of wed bliss .
look , just because we take our friend in do not mean that penny and i be afraid to be alone .
sheldon mention you try to get your brother to live with you , a well .
do you agree with that ?
well , now that you point it out
be you kid me ?
we do seem to keep find room mate .
dear , i would never come between you and leonard . that 's for your parade of room mate to do .
howard ? howard ? it 's me , it 's just me .
what be you do here ?
and if my heart stop , just let me go .
i 'm sorry , guy . sheldon be upset , leonard and penny be fight , i just want to go some place where i be n't cause problem .
i 'll say it again . india .
do n't do that . we 'll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning .
come on , i 'll get you some sheet . then i 'll see if i can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine .
never should 've have all these kid so close together .
you okay ?
i ca n't sleep .
what 's wrong ?
be that bother you ?
yes . i do n't care for unconscious thought . my brain and i be best friend . it should tell me everything .
i mean , how it relates to our relationship , not the bromance between you and your brain .
what if she 's correct ? do n't that say something trouble about u ?
that be true . do you know i figure out in which order i would eat all my friend in the event of an apocalypse ?
okay , listen to me . there be no reason to leave here . this be great . everyone 's nice . it 's comfortable . if all go accord to plan , this be my retirement home .
well than i feel in their steam shower ? i do n't think so .
penny would be the entree . then leonard 's basically a cheese course . and because i love you , you 're dessert .
good for you . this sandwich have six dollar worth of ham in it .
oh , great , it 'll be easy for you to look up at the star without a roof over your head .
morning .
do you know raj move out last night ?
i feel terrible .
well , you 're the one worried have someone live with u be a sign of problem .
oh , that be just because my mother get in my head . it 's like be possess , but instead of satan it 's , actually , it 's the same thing .
all right , so we 'll ask him to come back .
well , great .
do n't you want to get dress first ?
just one second . help , cinnamon 's loose in the building .
amy , quick , lock the door .
me , either . do n't want to be a burden . hey , be that the baby ? i 'll go check .
you be not a burden , and we want you to come back and stay with u .
but i also upset sheldon , and he 's not gon na want to come over if i 'm there .
and she 's have the time of her life .
just not in our bedroom , you dumbass .
i appreciate it , but i think stay with leonard and penny make more sense for everyone .
then it 's settle .
yup , we 're killin ' it .
you know , downward-facing dog come from the sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana .
oh , that 's beautiful . what do it mean ?
downward-facing dog .
yeah , i guess they do n't have sanskrit for butt up and head down .
hey , we write the kama sutra . if it involves butt , there 's a word for it .
oh , right , sorry .
it 's my fault . i ask penny to do yoga with me .
if you want , i can get ready in five minute .
it 's cute that you think that . do n't worry about it .
hey , can i ask you a favour ? would you mind take cinnamon for a walk ?
sure . you 're living here for free , i guess i owe you .
bye , cinnamon . be a good girl .
yeah , bye , sweetie .
bye .
yeah , yeah , bye , leonard .
okay , and tree pose .
well , she 's do .
thing have be go really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope .
why do n't you ask me what i 'm work on ?
oh , very well . what have you be work on ? and feel free to honk during the boring part .
i 'm do some experiment to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decide to move it .
so you 're attempt to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain .
yes , i 'm try to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond , precisely where and when an event of awareness take place .
well , what do you know ? here i be , wait to be bore with biology , and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy . which , unlike my body , be an okay place to tickle .
you know , when i be six , i want to marry the gorilla from good night , gorilla . maybe i be onto something .
gentleman , the most interest thing just happen with this spoon .
unless it be sing be our guest , i doubt it .
yeah , i picked it up without think about it . which raise a neuroscientific question , when do i decide to pick it up ?
the big question be , what be you gon na eat with that spoon ? you do n't get any food .
i understand it , sheldon .
yeah , me , too .
i 'm sorry , i space . be we still talk about the spoon ?
so do you confront jennifer ?
no , i be go to , but she call in sick . and guess who else call in sick .
paul .
paul .
who 's paul ?
oh , you met him at the office christmas party . he 's married to nancy .
oh , sure . wait , nancy ?
i bet jennifer get a promotion out of this , which be so unfair because i work twice a hard a she do .
do n't worry , jerry wo n't be fool by that type of behaviour .
jerry ?
it do n't work for randy , it do n't work for tina , it sure a hell be n't gon na work for jennifer .
well , i hope not . i just hate when people play those kind of game .
tina ?
with your sale record , you have nothing to worry about .
mm .
i go to your office christmas party ?
wait , be you say if we combine my experiment with your calculation , we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapse ?
it could be the most inspire combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee . it be like drinking two seventh of the rainbow .
sheldon , this be really interest .
yeah , and this one wo n't stain my teeth purple .
you know , we 've never collaborate professionally before . be you worried it might affect our relationship ?
that be a valid point . perhaps we should establish some ground rule .
well , that would make me feel well .
all right , let 's start right now . uh , rule number one , no use sexuality to get your way .
that 's a ridiculous rule .
be it ?
okay , how be that ?
i can actually feel the toxin be pull out of my skin .
well , this be a moisturize mask .
oh , well , then i can actually feel the moisture go into my skin .
i thought someone look brighter and tighter .
i 'd still like to know who jerry be .
do n't worry about it . hey , after this , how about we all go out and do something together ?
that would be great . thank you .
you want to go shopping ?
ooh , yes . fun .
or we could do something we 'll all enjoy , like play a board game .
i believe i 've make some progress on our ground rule .
can i see that ?
oh , of course . i 'll get that back . like all my underwear , that notebook say property of sheldon cooper .
sheldon , if we 're gon na have ground rule , i 'll tell you the first ground rule . i make the ground rule .
i 'd write that down , but i ca n't now , can i ?
i mean , they do n't say anything , but i just kind of felt like i be be a weird third wheel .
huh , so you can tell what that feel like . interest .
well , if your idea of fun be rid in a minivan to target for diaper , thing be about to get nut .
oh , it 's just nice to be with people who be happy to have me around . be n't that right , halley ?
well , at least someone have the courage to say it .
thank you , you be a good citizen . told you . go ahead , throw my underwear out the window . same thing 's gon na happen .
terrific . do you want to hear our new set of ground rule ?
fire away .
number one , we 're on the same team , we 're not in competition .
that 's smart , because sheldon _ , amy _ .
number two , disagreement can happen politely . there 's no need to call an idea stupid .
aw , someone drew a penis in it .
be you listen ?
i 'm sorry , go ahead .
number three , to avoid get frustrate , we take built-in break and reward our success with a small treat .
ooh , that sound fun . now , we 're talk about real treat , right ? not bible verse like my mother use to give me .
whatever you want . so , shall we get to work ?
wow . look at that .
yes , this be remarkable .
so we 're agree , it 's complete garbage .
well , be you worried he 's like another man in her life ?
a little , until i saw them in match top .
well , have you talk to them about it ?
well , what be i suppose to say , stop have fun without me ?
look , raj just get along with woman .
i know , but he be my friend first . it 's like she 's steal him and they 're just have the best time do all their dumb girly stuff together .
you sure you do n't fit in ? you sound like a catty bitch to me .
i do n't know where we go wrong .
yeah , the math be so inelegant . i 'm not even sure it make sense .
well , do n't give up . maybe we can fix it .
can you stop breathing so loud ? i can hear your nose whistle .
i can hear your face talk , so we 're even .
all right , either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown race .
fine . fine . you want me to blow my nose ? here , i 'll blow it . well ?
no , i can still hear it . oh , wait , that 's me . never mind , it 's fine .
you know , you 're exhaust . i knew work together be a bad idea .
hold on . i see what 's wrong here . we do the propagation only to the occipital lobe , not to the prefrontal cortex .
that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increase _ millisecond .
oh , that be much well . yeah , boy , if good idea come out of your brain the way mucus come out of your nose , we 'd be in good shape .
now , take a sip , swirl it around your mouth , and try to notice the flavour , the tannin , the texture . well ?
i probably should have spit out my gum first .
yeah . you know , the last couple of week have be pretty rough , but , uh , stay here with you guy have really help take my mind off of it .
mm . well , we 've love have you around . right , sweetie ? leonard ?
when do he leave ?
yeah , that 's rude .
jennifer still try to sleep her way to the top ?
yeah .
yeah , i wish i have that with howard .
it say right there on the invitation , buckle up for fun . it 's not my fault you do n't listen .
you 're entitle to feel how you feel . if you do n't like it , you should just talk to her .
oh , then maybe you should n't talk to her .
just because i be easily bother by light , heat , sound , smell and the way bird look at me do not mean i 'm sensitive .
hey , i wonder what kind of success we 'd have if we define measurement a the first moment that an action potential be see by the visual cortex .
that be a dare and insightful solution .
we 're finally make progress . i wish we could do it without fight .
what if the fight be the reason we 're make progress ?
i suppose it 's conceivable that the hormone associate with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpen our cognitive process .
well , if that 's the case , then your grandparent mumble and have bad posture .
how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey , wait a second . wait . delta t could equal alpha sub-zero .
it seem we have a choice to make . abandon all ground rule in the name of science , or give up collaborate for the sake of our relationship .
there 's only one clear choice .
science it be .
no , you bonehead .
name call , that be perfect . now , when i get to this equation here , really let me have it . you know ? if it help , i 'm not the sharpest dresser .
anyway , i know it 's silly , but since raj move in , i 've be feel a little left out .
well , sweetie , that 's crazy .
no , no , penny , do n't dismiss his feeling .
thank you . i just feel
hang on , i 'm not say that his feeling be n't crazy . i just do n't want him to think that this be n't a safe place .
well , to be truthful
well , why would n't this be a safe place ? i mean , he 's surround by his wife and one of his best friend .
i do n't want to speak for leonard .
but when you 're insecure , no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe .
yeah , you 're right . you know , you 're really sensitive about this kind of stuff .
i 'm a good listener .
yeah .
hey , olsen twin
what ?
well , i mean , i 'm sit right here . you 're talk about my feeling and somehow leave me out of the conversation .
i 'm sorry . what do you want to say ?
i do n't know , you pretty much cover it .
can you read them back ?
revise ground rule number one , we be on the same team , but it be a competition .
excellent . excellent . and on a related point , you 're go down , punk .
revise ground rule number two , there be definitely stupid question , and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face .
i love that one .
thanks , babe . number three , fair topic for insult include educational pedigree , scientific field , intellectual prowess , and mama .
yeah , that list be strong . like your mother 's urge to be promiscuous with sailor .
look at this . elon musk have a theory that we 're all just character in some advanced civilization 's video game .
so some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me ?
all right , we get a problem .
what 's up ?
the air force contact me about our quantum gyroscope . they want to have a meeting .
really ?
yeah . this military guy show up at howard 's door . he be terrify .
oh , what do he say ?
he give me his business card and ask me to please pas it along to howard .
that do n't sound terrify .
to a white guy born here , no . if you be a brown guy whose name have a lot of syllable in it , terrify .
you realize if the military declares our research classify , they can take the whole thing away from u .
and if that happens , we 'll never be able to sell it commercially .
there go our big payday .
i be counting on that money . i need to make a much a my wife so i do n't have to try so hard in bed .
you do that , too ?
oh , yeah . how do you think i stay this thin ?
gentleman , i think we be lose sight of the real issue . we be on the precipice of become faceless cog in the military-industrial complex . be n't that excite ?
not at all . in star war , when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation , harass civilian , do n't you ever think , hey , that could be me ?
sheldon , we could be contribute to a weapon system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand year .
i 'm worried about howard . ever since that guy from the air force show up , he 's be a nervous wreck .
he wo n't take any pill that be n't chewable and shape like a flintstone .
you know , when leonard 's feel anxious i make him take a long walk .
do that help ?
i do n't believe this .
this guy from the office just congratulate me on be pregnant .
no one at the office do . do you tell anyone ?
i bet it be barbara chen in retrovirus . she might have heard me throw up one morning . every since she get the hearing aid , she think she 's so great .
‘ cause i 'm up for a major immunotherapy study , and if they find out i 'm pregnant they might give it to someone else .
i know they would , they do it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she be pregnant .
wail till i snapchat that my friend might be work on a top secret government project .
be you crazy ? you ca n't put that on snapchat .
fine , i 'll put it on facebook like a caveman .
you know , maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer .
that 's not a bad idea .
well , you must have someone in your family that 's a lawyer .
why ? because i 'm jewish ? that 's like me say , hey , you 're indian , do n't your cousin work in a call centre ?
my cousin do work in a call centre .
and my cousin 's a lawyer .
we do n't need howard 's cousin . no , we have me .
you 're not a lawyer , sheldon , you 're just a know-it-all .
i be not a know-it-all . i 'm a person who know lot of thing and like to correct other people when they 're wrong .
that 's the definition of be a know-it-all .
or in german , a besserwisser .
i have a plan . i kept leave dove bar wrapper around to explain any weight gain .
from all the dove bar i ate . i 'm pregnant . try to keep up . i 'm sorry , i have to go find out if my bos know .
thanks . you guy be the best .
yeah , drive safe . we love you . and give u a call oh , my god , it be me , it be me . i 'm the one who blabbed she be pregnant !
i forgot my coat .
oh , here 's your coat , honey . that 's such a cute jacket . oh god , i feel so bad , i just lie to her .
oh , but you do it so well . that 's amaze , it 's like watch a sculptor , but your clay be lie .
i mean , seriously , you have get to let me scan your brain when you 're be dishonest so i can see what light up .
that 's super helpful , amy . thanks a lot . i ca n't wait to do that .
i can see a clump of bitch cell lightin ' up from here .
give me a second to call my cousin .
i do n't see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regard intellectual property .
first of all , he 's in boca raton , which be well than fort lauderdale . but more importantly , he last two day on jeopardy , so he 's clearly a smart guy .
hello .
hey , no problem . thanks for go to outer space so no matter what i do my mom will be disappointed in me .
well , i married a little catholic girl , so we 're even . anyway , this be leonard and sheldon . the three of u come up with the guidance system .
hello .
and this be my friend , raj .
oh , i 'm not on the patent . i 'm just here because there 's a bumblebee in my office .
i saw it . it 's big .
that 's not what i meant .
that 's not what i meant .
howard , why be he yell at me ?
all right , you be on jeopardy . allow me to alex trebek this and put it in the form of a question : who have be a complete waste of our time ?
marty , let me call you back .
someday , when i 'm up on murder charge , you 'll be hearing from me .
you do n't need him . i 'll represent you .
hey . what brings you by ?
oh . how be it ?
fell asleep ?
i 'm furious .
no . i confront barbara chen , but she claimed she do n't know what i be talk about .
why do you do that ?
get out .
oh , you know , i also lie about the girl in the bathroom . yeah , we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth .
i do n't understand why i ca n't talk at this meeting .
‘ cause when you talk , it enrages people .
okay . quick question . be i allow to exchange pleasantry upon meeting this colonel ?
yes .
i 'm get enrage .
no .
do n't speak .
gentleman , i 'm colonel williams . thank you for meeting with me .
hi .
so , which one of you be the brain behind all this ?
and because of the quantum vortex , this can run perpetually ?
well , i 'm a scientist by training .
mit .
oh , well , let me put your mind at ease . what we use it for be none of your business .
yes , it 's this much less big .
well , i ran it by some colleague at mit , and they thought they could get it do in four month .
oh , thanks . you know , i just want to get some work do without people congratulate me about the baby every five minute .
do you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat ?
i 'm sorry . my bos want to meet with me , and i 'm stress .
i 've work so hard to get where i be , and i do n't want to get sent back to square one because i 'm pregnant .
thank you .
well , you brought me french fry . that 's a start .
and a chocolate shake .
hi .

do he even like lemon bar ?
not really . but i 'm mad at him , too , so lemon bar it be .
something happen at the meeting ?
they make me promise i would n't talk .
mm . if it make you feel any well , a parasitoid wasp know a oobius depressus have be rediscover after _ year of presume extinction .
why would that make me feel well ?
why would your bernadette thing make me feel well ? at least mine be educational .
okay . never mind .
look , i 'm sorry . tell me why bernadette be upset with you .
well , i told people at work that she 's pregnant . she be n't ready for them to know .
why would you do that ?
well , it just slip out . i feel terrible .
see , that 's exactly what happen to me , except that i say it on purpose , and i have no regret .
be it even possible to get this do in two month ?
well , maybe . i do n't know . we 'll have to work _ hour a day , seven day a week .
which mean i wo n't be able to make penny breakfast every day , and she 'll realize my brioche french toast be the only thing keep her in the marriage .
i love your french toast .
oh , thanks , man .
so , why do you guy even agree to the deadline ?
we do n't . sheldon do .
and you just let him ?
well , the colonel say it be for the good of the country , and the funding be substantial .
no , but mostly , there be an awkward pause , and i broke it by say okay .
oh , look like it .
wow . you 're go off to work with the military , leave me behind . now i know how all those army wife feel .
would you stop ? we 're just gon na be on the other side of campus .
and right here .
you be a deeply silly man .
he be so afraid of his feeling .
get a minute ?
i just want to apologize . i know what you do be an accident .
for what it 's worth , you 're a great liar .
hey , i learn a long time ago , when you 're four foot eleven and eye level with every guy 's crotch , that 's where you punch .
do you know what ? it 's just a research project . the most important job in the world be gon na be raise this child . it 's all i need to give my life meaning .
you believe me ? oh , good . _ more chump like you , i 'll have the jury eat out of my hand .
i never realize this building be classify .
maybe that 's because it 's classify .
wish we be n't so far from my parking space .
the way you put away those lemon bar , perhaps that 's a good thing .
i 'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule .
why ? it clearly do n't work .
i guess this be it .
be that a retinal scanner ?
howard wolowitz , access grant .
no way .
impressive .
leonard hofstadter , access grant .
access deny .
it know .
yay .
hey , leonard , if you 're not busy tomorrow , i have to do a little reception after work .
oh , i would , but we need to make a push on the air force project .
oh , be you sure ? we 're celebrate our new add drug , and it 'll probably be over in , like , six minute .
yeah , why ?
well , sheldon say that he be gon na work with me on our quantum perception project .
we 've have this plan for a week .
well , he reconfirm with me this morning .
guy , before this get ugly , remember , the winner get sheldon .
hey , raj , do you want to go with me tomorrow ?
be you ask because you want me there or out of pity ? actually , never mind , do n't answer . i 'd love to .
hello .
why do you tell leonard you 're work on the gyroscope tomorrow ?
because i be .
but you say you be work with me .
uh-oh . someone 's get two date to the nerd prom .
i have a plan to work on both project simultaneously . and for your information , the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech be nerd prom .
well , i 'm not need at both place at the same time . and i can also free up extra hour with simple trick , such a use a minimal amount of word to convey my point .
genius . i be gon na say , why do anyone think sheldon 's a genius ? but i do n't .
gentleman , i 've get amy up and run . shall we get to work ?
uh , before we do , what be you wear , oh , friend who we pretend be normal ?
these be hydration backpack . for efficiency , whenever i 'm thirsty i have access to water . when i 'm hungry , i have lentil soup .
it 's get harder to pretend .
anyway , sheldon , we 're at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter .
run down the pro and con of each for me .
well , if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler , it 'll be cool immediately before it reacts with the conduction .
oh , sorry , uh , carrot chunk .
you can just feel the time be save .
ah , i 'm back , you get me for eight minute .
the rate of spin for the central axis centrifuge have to be four revolution per second .
it ca n't be four revolution , it 's get to be seven .
seven ? look at the board , it 's four .

that do n't make any sense . she know i have a girlfriend .
well , sometimes woman do n't care . sometimes it make them want a guy even more .
that may be true , but dr nowitzki 's just a friend . in fact , i would n't have even notice she 's a woman if she have n't worn that bathing suit that highlight her bosom .
okay . um , let 's try this . think of yourself a one of those limited edition toy people like to collect .
i already do .
well , then you get it .
because there 's only one of me , i 'm more valuable .
right .
although , amy 's already take me out of my package and played with me .
let 's forget the toy thing , okay ? um , maybe
penny , look . i appreciate your concern , but i do n't think that 's what 's happen .
all right . what do you think be happen ?

and you be worried about the romance . _
wait . why do n't you guy stay across the hall , and we will live here ?
interest . if my official residence be across the hall , i wonder if i 'd need to knock every time i come over here .
that 's a good question . maybe just do n't come over .
historically , i do n't do well with change .
okay , it wo n't be that bad . we would n't even sit in your spot while you 're go .
you 're darn right , you would n't . no matter where i be , this will always be my spot . like an embassy in a foreign country , this seat be the sovereign soil of my bottom .
just nod and smile . he 's almost go .

this be such a relief . honestly , if it do n't get you all work up , i 'd kiss you right now .

do n't matter to me . your choice .
no , no , we 're living together now , everything 's equal . you know ? i know that i have a tendency to be control , so i would rather you choose .
well , clearly , it 's not whatever i want , because what i want be for you to make this decision , and you refuse to do that .
well , i 'm not refuse . i 'm just try to be considerate .
like when you let me get those shoe with the wheel on the bottom , and then watch me roll right into traffic ?
sheldon , will you please just pick a side ?
fine . okay . now , on this side , i be closer to the exit in case of emergency .
great . that 's your side .
no , but i 'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack .
okay , i 'll take that side .
ah , then again , what be the odds of someone attack me ?
rise rapidly .
now , this side offer me proximity to the bathroom , but i be closer to the window where pervert can watch me sleep .
okay . what if we do this ?
i suppose that work .
great .
this be ridiculous . the doctor know what the baby be , the ultrasound tech know , raj know , his grey 's anatomy online fan group probably know . be it weird we do n't ?
i be disappointed to see the man i be engage to pull rainbow scarf out of his fly .
everyone say i could do well .
but you do n't listen , and presto change-o , my baby 's inside you . ta-da .
ugh . what be that ? why do you switch side ?
be grateful i 'm still in the room .
comfy ?
oh , i 'm just happy i do n't know what this memory foam remembers .

that 's it . it 's sheldon 's bedtime , he be in for the night .
wow . i can not believe we be alone in our own apartment .
so , what do you want to do ?

well , i do n't , and it 's your fault .
how ? you have the whole floor to yourself .
sheldon , maybe living together be a bad idea .

sheldon , i understand that you like thing a certain way and i 'm willing to make some concession , but you have to be open to compromise .
she 's right . that 's reasonable .

should we say something to him ?
i meant like , what be you do here ?
nah , that 's not gon na hurt his feeling .
look , here 's the thing you need to understand about sheldon . he 's the bad .
i prefer to think of it a high-maintenance .
i prefer to think of myself a five-ten , but i still need to get all my pant hem .
i guess i should have know what i be get myself into .
do n't beat yourself up . you 've never live with anyone before .
that 's true .
and you 're start out with sheldon cooper . that 's like get your first pet and have it be , i do n't know , what 's a kind of pet that ruin your life ?
you 're not make me feel well .
look , even when penny and i start living together , there be a learn curve . but i promise you , it do get easy .
he put a sign up in the bathroom that say , number of day without amy 's hair on the soap .
be it me , or be there something fun about watch him just float there ?
be someone else here ?
what be you do here ?
do they ?
i told you raccoon do n't say uh-oh .
you know , one night , leonard 's nose whistle so loud , i swear it be like sleep on a train track .
have you notice it 's always an a-flat ?
be it ? oh . it 's like his sinus be right here in the car .
if we 're just go to drive around aimlessly , the least you could do be take me for ice cream .
oh , please , you 're barely interested in a physical relationship with one person . why would you want to confuse and disappoint others ?
be with amy have awoken the sexual creature within . when i see a pretty gal walk down the street , i think , hubba hubba , like any other guy .
you kiss your mother with that mouth ? ‘ cause it 's fine .
thank you .
you say you get it back .
well , clearly , i lie .
not great . the electricity 's out .
i call , and they 're like , pay your bill .

what ? when do that happen ?
oh . sorry . i do n't know .
why would n't he tell u ? be we bad friend ?
so you 're back out on the date scene now ?
oh , that must be fun . how 's that go ?
i 'm in a hot tub with you , so pretty bad .
maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule .
no , do n't do that .
but you do .
exactly . learn from my mistake . no matter where i be at 7:18am , there well be a toilet nearby .
it 's just so much easy to give him what he want .
oh , true , but think of how much you 've accomplish . who get him to stop purelling his pocket change ?
me .
and who get him to put thing other than glove in the glove compartment ?
me . it be mitten .
and who get him to try a turkey dog ?
that be actually koothrappali , but i do let him spit it out in my hand .
how can you stop now ? that 's like walk out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy .
you know , you 're right . i 'm in this relationship , too . i need to stand up for myself .
of course you do .
and if he do n't like it , he can move back here .
oh . he can try . he 'd just need a good locksmith .
well , who you gon na hit on ? the girl in front of u get strawberry . that 's your favourite .
no . no , if we both like it , i 'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and go , aw , no strawberry .
what about the girl behind the counter ?
hmm ? well , she spends her whole day scoop . one arm 's probably big than the other .
be it possible you might not actually want to meet someone ?
thank you .
i 'd say wise beyond your year , but you 're get up there .
all right . come on . what be really go on with you ?
penny , i be go to tell you a story that i 've never told anyone .
all right .
oh , that 's awful .
i know . it 's also why i never open a door without knock three time . i mean , the first one 's traditional , but two and three be for people to get their pant on .
well , what happen with your dad ?
we lock eye , i ran to my room , and we never , ever spoke of it .
since amy and i have be living together , we 've be bickering like my parent use to .
and you 're afraid you 're gon na do something like your dad do ?
yes . i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road .
well , anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone .
honey , instead of worry about pain you might cause in the future , how about try to fix the pain you 're cause her right now ?
i 'm sure you 're right . i suppose i should apologize to you , a well .
okay .
that must have hurt watch me look for other woman without ever even consider you . please understand that i think of you a more of a nanny .
just finish your ice cream so i can get you home to bed .
i do n't know . bernadette 's baby do n't have a jacuzzi jet hit just the right spot .
what do you do in there ?
it 's call relax , and that 's all you need to know .
yeah , you 're probably right .
yeah , just give me a minute .
well , you know how you 're wear a bathing suit ?
i kind of go the other way .
you jackass just bought yourselves a hot tub !
what do you think ?
it 's a nice enough spot . you know , if i 'm go to start stand up for myself , this be exactly the kind of thing

the woman at the wall store ?
let it go .
be you go to confront penny ?
eventually , i guess . although , i be kind of curious how long she think she can keep hiding my stuff without me know .

i 'm just contemplate buridan 's donkey .
i understand . i 'll leave you be .
what , you 're familiar with the reference ?
of course . jean buridan propose a philosophical thesis state that a hungry donkey place between two equidistant bale of hay would be paralyse by indecision and would starve to death .
exactly .
well , i would n't want you to starve to death , so here 's an eggplant .
thank you .
you know , some people believe that buridan be plagiarize aristotle .
really ?

bert be study the way microbe in rock can survive in extreme environmental condition .
they say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planet .
you know what , i 've met bert . be n't he an indicator of life on other planet ?

who be it ?
where do you get that ?

yeah , i 've have him since level ten . his name be button . anyway , if you have your own game character we could hang out , maybe go on a quest .
uh , sound interest .
so you 'll think about it ?
oh , i do n't think i 'll be able to stop think about it .
smooth .
we 're home .
oh , my god , what happen ?
well , your ex-boyfriend sends his regard and i think the rest be fairly self-explanatory .
i 'm so sorry , i really thought if you guy go instead of me he would n't be such an as .
no , it be a valid hypothesis .
really ? great .
thank you . you 're not do with her , be you ?
not to mention imaginary .
be thai food okay with you penny ?
sure .
we ca n't have thai food , we have indian for lunch .
so ?
they 're both curry base cuisine .
so ?
they would be gastronomically redundant . i can see we 're go to have to spell out everything for this girl .
any idea raj ?
turn left on lake street and head up to colorado . i know a wonderful little sushi bar that have karaoke .
that sound like fun .
i do n't know what your odds be in the world a a whole , but a far a the population of this car go , you 're a veritable mack daddy .
skynet be kinky ? i do n't know .
artificial intelligence do not have teen fetish .
alright , oh wait , they use it to in
, too late , i win .
let 's go-oh-oh ou-oooo-ut tonight . i have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight .
what the hell be that ?
i do n't know , but if cat could sing , they 'd hate it too . .
you wan na prowl , be my night owl , we 'll take my hey guy , hi ! where you go ?
what ? oh we just have to mail some letter and throw away some chicken .
you 'll never guess what just happen .
oh , i give up .
i do n't guess . a a scientist i reach conclusion base on observation and experimentation , although a i 'm say this it occurs to me you may have be employ a rhetorical device render my response moot .
what be that ?
alright , remember when i audition for that workshop production of rent , but i do n't get it and i could n't figure out why ?
i have a conclusion base on an observation .
no you do n't . no he do n't .
well , the girl they picked to play mimi , she drop out and they ask me to replace her .
oh , congratulation , what a lucky break .
it 's not a big deal , just a one night showcase , but they invite a lot of cast people and agent so , you never know .
no you do n't . he do n't .
no .
because . uh , friday , we be attend a symposium on molecular positronium .
i think that 's a week from tuesday at six .
no , it 's this friday , at eight .
you just lie to penny .
yes , i do .
and you do it so casually , no rapid breathing , no increase in perspiration .
so ?
so , lack of a physiological response while lie be characteristic of a violent sociopath .
sheldon , be you worried about your safety .
no , i imagine if you be go to kill me you 'd have do it a long time ago .
that 's very true .
leonard , leonard , leonard
what ?
i need to speak to you .
it 's two o'clock in the morning
it 's important .
i highly doubt that . go away . . be you still out there ?
yes .
what ?
you 're right , it can wait until morning .
what , what , what , what , what ?
sheldon , what be it ?
i 'm uncomfortable have be include in your lie to penny .
what be i suppose to say .
you could have told her the truth .
that would have hurt her feeling .
be that a relevant factor ?
then i suppose you could have agree to go .
i could n't say that , i would have to say , you be terrific and i ca n't wait to hear you sing again .
why ?
it 's the social protocol , it 's what you do when you have a friend who 's proud of something they really suck at .
i be not aware of that .
oh , alright . leonard .
yes .
when we played chess earlier , you be terrific and i ca n't wait to play you again . goodnight .
leonard , leonard , leonard , leonard , …..
oooaw . this would be so much easy if i be a violent sociopath . what ?
i be analyse our lie , and i believe we 're in danger of penny see through the ruse .
well , sir , my trouser will not be ignite today .
penny , penny , penny , good morning .
what do you want ?
remember how leonard told you we could n't come to your performance because we be attend a symposium on molecular positronium ?
i remember symposium .
yes , well , he lie .
wait , what ?
he lie , and i 'm feel very uncomfortable about it .
well imagine how i 'm feel .
hungry ? tire ? i 'm sorry this really be n't my strong suit .
you told her i lie , why would you tell her i lie ?
to help you .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not see the help .
she be go to see through your lie eventually , so i told her that you be lie to protect me .
oh , i 'm get a bad feel .
hunger ? indigestion , i 'm sorry i 'm really not very good at this . anyway , penny now believe that on friday night , we 're go to participate in my cousin leopold 's drug intervention .
yea , who most people call leo , but he also answer to lee , remember that , it 's important .
what 's important ?
detail , leonard , the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turn on detail .
do you have a cousin leopold .
no , i make him up . i think you 'd call him lee .
i do n't get it , i already told her a lie , why replace it with a different lie ?
well , first of all , your lie be laughably transparent , where mine be exquisitely convolute . while you be sleep i be weave an un-unravelable web .
un-unravelable ?
yes , if she google leopold houston she 'll find a facebook page , an online blog depict his descent into drug use , and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com .
okay , why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing .
ah , because it 's in long beach , and i do n't drive .
we 're go to long beach ?
no , of course not , there 's no cousin leo , there 's no intervention , focus leonard .
oh , come on !
we just leave the house on friday night , and we return in the wee hour emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab .
so he go back into rehab ?
yes , but , he can relapse if penny ever invite u to go hear her sing again .
you still told her i lie .
for a noble purpose , to spare me the social embarrassment of have a drug-addled first cousin , which i 'm assume be embarrass , yes ?
so she 's expect me to lie about go to a symposium in pasadena , when in actuality we 're pretend to go to a drug intervention in long beach ?
un-unravelable .
oh hey penny , wow , look at you , all ready for your showcase , you look great .
thanks . i just want to come by and wish you guy luck with your symposium .
i do n't know what to say .
it 's okay , leonard
oh , okay , alright , good .
oh boy , group hug .
uh-huh !
uh-huh !
wait a minute , farminfarmian be speak and you 're bogarding the symposium .
howard , i 'm sorry we're we 're
i do n't know what to say .
wow .
howard , listen
howard , wait . sheldon , i think we should tell them .
okay , sure . i do n't see a problem with that .
there 's no symposium , leonard lie to me , be n't that right leonard .
well i do n't know what to say .
it 's okay , i do , look , leonard be help sheldon through a family crisis , he make up the whole story about the symposium with dr farmin..farm…ian
good for you .
hah , yeah ! because he do n't want sheldon to be embarrass , and there be nothing to be embarrass okay , every family in america have a relative hole up in a garage somewhere huff paint thinner .
oh , another hug , thank you .
alright you guy , good luck .
thanks penny .
yeah , uh , break a leg .
break a leg .
so , road trip to long beach .
no , we 're not go to long beach .
why not ?
because sheldon do n't have a drug addict cousin leopold .
oh , too bad . i 've always want to go to long beach .
it 's a very nice community . the queen mary be docked there , once the large ocean liner in the world , it 's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly grip murder mystery dinner .
sound fun .
i 'm game .
shotgun .
wait , be we really go to long beach ?
leonard , leonard , leonard
what be you talk about , it 's fine , she bought it , it 's over .
sadly , it 's not . substance abuse be a lifelong struggle , but beyond that i have realise that the leo i described would not have agree to go to rehab .
why not ?
because leo be a middle child .
i 've get a solution .
morning .
i be sheldon 's cousin leo .
oh , sheldon , be we really go to go with pop psychology .
for your information , this be all base on solid research , stick with the character profile i write for you .
sheldon ?
it be more of a double major actually . theatre and physic . you can guess which one my bourgeois parent push me towards .
yeah , i get it , sheldon , why ?
well , you see , while leo would not have go into rehab , it be completely plausible that we would have talk him into leave the motel , and come home with u .
sheldon , how about this a my motivation . when i be fourteen year old i be abuse in the philippine by a club foot navy chaplain .
hi . how do the intervention go .
unfortunately , we be n't able to convince him to go to rehab .
well , base on what you told me , i 'm not surprised .
but we do convince him to leave the motel . come say hello . leo , this be penny , our friend and neighbour .
let me ask you something , penny . have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel , cover in your own vomit , next to a transsexual prostitute ?
then do n't ask me how i 'm feel .
well , that 's leo . hey , um , why do n't you tell me about your showcase last night ?
oh , it be okay i guess , be n't a big turn out but they both really seem to like it .
there be only two people there ?
damn you , chaplain horrigan !
that 's never be proven .
not double blind study .
how could there be a double blind study , who would be the control group .
a you can see , detox can get pretty ugly , let 's give them some privacy .
yeah . hey , do you want to come over to my place , have coffee ?
sound good .
i have a video of me sing last night , do you want to see it ?
gee , why would n't i ?
and that he love the companionship and the wisdom that his own father fail to provide .
this be amaze . just sit on a couch , watch tv with a woman . not be drunk , or high , or or wonder if you 're a dude down there .
one day at a time , penny , one day at a time .
how long be he go to stay here .
he 's a homeless drug addict , leonard , where be he go to go ? boy , you have a lot to learn about lie .
checkmate .
o-o-o-o-h ! again ?
obviously you 're not well suit for three-dimensional chess , perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed .
just reset the board .
it must be humble to suck on so many different level .
hi guy .
hey !
do you get my mail .
yeah , right here . how be nebraska ?
oh , well than north dakota ! i guess that joke 's only funny in nebraska .
from the data at hand you really ca n't draw that conclusion . all you can say with absolute certainty be that that joke be not funny here .
boy , it 's good to be back .
how be your family ?
sick ?
here we go .
what kind of sick ?
oh , the flu i guess .
i do n't need you to guess , i need you to know , now when do the symptom first appear ?
maybe friday .
friday , be that morning or afternoon ?
i i don't
think woman , who blew their nose and when ?
oh , it 's okay , i understand .
thanks for your consideration , now please leave .
you 'd well go before he start spray you with lysol .
okay , well , thank you for get my mail .
no problem . welcome home .
what ?
what the hell be you do ?
with lime jello ?
leonard ! if i 'm go to get ahead of this thing i need to find out what 's grow in my throat .
sheldon , you be not sick . this be , but you be not .
we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny have introduce into our environment . and have never be to nebraska i 'm fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibody .
sheldon , do n't you think you 're overreact ?
when i 'm lie comatose in a hospital rely on inferior mind to cure me , these jello culture and my accompany note will give them a fight chance .
i 'm go back to bed .
wait . put this in the bathroom .
what for ?
i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidney be n't shut down .
i mix pancake batter in this !
no , that measure cup have always be for urine .
you have time to make a label for everything in this apartment , include the label maker , but you do n't have ten second to make one that say urine cup ?
it 's right here on the bottom .
huh . i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology .

and there be no-one there to take care of you ?
no . no , my mum have to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house have slip off the cinderblocks again .

the living room appear to be empty .
okay , he must be in his bedroom . my spare glass be in my bedroom , on my dresser , next to my bat-signal .
i 'm not go in there .
no way , jose .
well i ca n't do it , i ca n't see anything .
it 's all right , wireless mini-cam and bluetooth headset . we 'll be your eye .
wo n't my footstep set it off ?
no , you 'll be on your hand and knee . now you 'll need to get the sensor a close a you can to sheldon 's room .
stay low . bear left . now keep true .
what ?
it mean go straight .
then just say go straight .
you do n't stay go straight when you 're give bearing , you say keep true .
alright i just hit my head .
because you do n't keep true . okay , turn right .
it be n't on ?
no .
then why do i have to crawl ?
oh , i guess you do n't .
okay , it 's on .
good . from this point forward you will have to crawl .
i know .
hang on , the sensor 's pick up something , turn your head back .
you rat bastard .
told you the sensor would work .
hi !
you deliberately stuck me with sheldon .
well , i have to , you see what he 's like .
penny ! penny , i 'm hungry .
uh , it 's okay , sweetie , good news , leonard 's home !
no !
here you go , good luck , bye .
w-wait !
leonard , i 'm hungry !
wait ! penny ! take me with you !
i want grill cheese .
do you think penny will come here and take care of u ?
i do n't think penny 's ever come here again .
i 'm very congest .
yeah , so ?
can you go to the kitchen , and get me the turkey baster label mucus .
if i stand , i 'll vomit .
under the sink , yellow tupperware bowl .
here 's the problem with teleportation .
how about that .
personally , i would never use a transporter . because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrate in order to create a new sheldon .
would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon ?
no , he would be exactly the same .
that be a problem .
gentleman , i 'd like you to meet dennis kim . dennis be a highly sought after doctorial candidate and we 're hop to have him do his graduate work here .
well , i lose a year while my family be tunnel out of north korea .
i already know you 're not . you do n't have an open science grid computer , or a free electron laser , and the string theory research be do here be nothing but a dead end .
yes sir .
i mean , the whole landscape of false vacuum in string theory could be a large a ten to the five-hundredth power . in addition ooh , look , chocolate milk .
i sense a disturbance in the force .
a bad feel i have about this , mmm-hmmm .
so do you . except for your tendency to end sentence with preposition .
nope . goodbye .
look like you 're do work in quantum loop correction .
you see where you go wrong , do n't you ?
leonard .
huh , yeah ?
get him out .
do i look like i lift weight .
it 's startle to me you have n't consider a lorentz invariant field theory approach .
have you consider it ?
get him out leonard .
wow , you won the stephenson award .
really , how old ?
you be the young person ever to win it .
it 's like look into an obnoxious little mirror , be n't it ?
mmm , this be really delicious , be n't it ? still ca n't talk to me unless you 're drunk , huh ? oh , sweetie , you be so damage .
hey , i 'm damage too . how about a hug for howie ?
sure . raj , hug howard .
uh-uh-uh .
something you 'd like to share ? a tale of woe perhaps .
fifteen year old . dennis kim be fifteen year old , and he 's already correct my work . today i go from be wolfgang amadeus mozart to you know , that other guy .
antonio salieri ?
oh , god , now even you 're smarter than me .
you know , sheldon , you do n't have so many friend that you can afford to start insult them .
just eat , sheldon , you 'll feel well .
why waste food . in texas when a cow go dry they do n't keep feed it , they just take her out and shoot her between the eye .
i 'm confuse , do sheldon stop give milk ?
you ca n't let this kid get to you . you always knew that someday someone would come along who be young and smarter .
yes , but i assume i would have be dead hundred of year , and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg .
so , you 've get a bit of competition , i really do n't see what the big deal be .
well of course you do n't , you 've never excel at anything .
i do n't understand , exactly how do he get any friend in the first place ?
we like leonard .
you know , i 'm confuse again , be he wait , or do we get to shoot him between the eye ?
hey .
hey .
i 've decide you 're right . my career be not over .
but , since the arrival of dennis kim have render my research pointless , i just have to find something else to focus on .
great .
so i 've decide , i 'm go to collaborate with you .
great .
what exactly be it you do ? i know you chatter on about it all the time , but i 've never really paid attention .
okay , well , right now i 'm design an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level , but i really do n't need any help .
oh , sure you do . now , see , what 's this here in the schematic , be that a laser array ?
yes .
no . hmmm . what happens if you use argon laser instead of helium neon ?
it would blow up .
be you sure ?
pretty sure .
alright .
go away .
so , this be engineering , huh ?
i 'll talk to you later .
engineering . where the noble semi-skilled labourer execute the vision of those who think and dream . hello , oompah-loompahs of science .
sheldon , what be you do here ?
i just come by to say hello .
i 've be at this lab for three year , you 've never come by to say hello .
well , up until now i 've have well thing to do . so , what be we make today ?
a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that 's go up on the next space shuttle .
really , how do it work ?
uh , huh . so it 's a shelf ?
no , you do n't understand , during acceleration it need to stay perfectly level and provide yeah , okay , it 's a shelf .
now , i notice you 're use titanium , do you give any consideration to carbon nanotube , they 're lighter , cheaper and half twice the tensile strength .
sheldon , there 's a diploma in my office that say i have a master in engineering .
and you also have a note from your mother that say i love you , bubbula . but neither of those be a cogent argument for titanium over nanotube .
sheldon .
yes .
go away .
do leonard tell you to say that ?
no , i thought of it all by myself .
huh . it ca n't be a coincidence . there must be some causal link i 'm miss .
go away .
curiouser and curiouser .
be he here ?
if he be , i would n't be .
do you know what he do . he watch me work for ten minute , and then start to design a simple piece of software that could replace me .
like what ? he 'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid be smarter and more accomplish than he be .
well , what if something be to happen to this boy so he be no longer a threat to sheldon ?
then our problem would be solve .
hang on , be we talk about murder dennis kim ? i 'm not say no .
we ca n't send him back to north korea . he know how to get out .
the only thing we need to do be make this kim kid lose his focus .
that wo n't happen , he 's not interested in anything but physic .
what about biology ?
what ?
you know , biology ? the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind .
howard , he 's fifteen .
yeah , so , when i be fifteen i met denise polmerry and my grade point average fell from a _ to a _ .
she be sleep with you ?
oh , hey guy , what 's up ?
we need a hot fifteen year-old asian girl with a thing for smart guy .
what ?
howard , that 's racist , any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick .
dr cooper ? oh , be we interrupt ?
who will come ?
what if they do n't come .
okay , well , um , speak of spread , we 're have a small welcome party this afternoon for mr kim , who 's agree to join u here at the university .
okay , well , uh , obviously you 're very busy with your uh , um , come dennis . you 'll have to excuse dr cooper , he 's be under a lot of um he 's nut .
ah , la-la-la , hava nagila . they 'll come , they 'll settle and i 'll win the prize
go away .
please go away .
really , i be not aware of that .
hm ?
smooth .
there 's the man of the hour .
okay , so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate woman .
all he have to do now be hook up with one of them .
we need a social catalyst .
like what ? we ca n't get fifteen year-old girl drunk .
or can we ?
no , we ca n't .
be you cry ?
no , i have allergy .
okay , so not her either . how about her ?
interest , kind of pretty , a little chubby so probably low self-esteem .
i think that 's our girl . one of u should go talk to her .
i ca n't talk to her , you do it .
i ca n't just go up and talk to her . howard , you talk to her .
oh no , she 'll never go for the kid once she get a peek at this .

it 's actually a tremendous bargain , even with shipping it work out to less than four dollar a pound .
cocktain shrimp be $ _ .
how be we go to get it upstairs ?

oh , hey guy .
uh , hi penny . take a break , guy !
oh , just , you know , move something upstairs .
what be it ?
it's you know , time machine .
yeah , okay , neat , but i really get to get to work , so .
uh , just give u a few minute .
you 're joking , right ?
oh , i never joke when it come to vertigo .
hey , if you wait for u to set up the time machine , i can drop you off at work yesterday . time travel joke , it 's not never mind .
for what it 's worth , i thought it be humorous .
let 's just do this . guy , ready to push ?
in a minute . howard step outside to throw up .
i do n't know what you be worried about . i think it really work in the room .
second .
i still want it on my balcony . i say we move it on a bi-monthly basis .
that sound fair .
twice a month .
then no .
okay , every other month .
good choice , alexander graham bell invents the telephone and call out for dr watson .
wait a minute , i 'd want to see that too .
so , when it 's your turn you can .
but if we all go back to the same point in time , bell 's lab be go to get very crowd , he 'll know something 's up .
mr bell be deaf , she 's not even go to hear you knock .
oh , i have a solution , first go into the future and obtain a cloak device .
ooh , how far into the future ?
if i remember correctly , captain kirk will steal a cloak device from the romulans on stardate _ , which will be january 10th _ by pre-federation reckon .
okay , i be set the dial for january 10th , _ . here we go into the future . that be fun .
my turn .
okay , first of all , what you call a gap be nearly three foot wide , i slip and skin my knee .
that do n't sound too bad .
it be eight course of lamb , and they try to fix me up with their son .
sorry .
not do . by the time i finally get to work , they 'd give my shift away . yeah , that 's right , i 've lose an entire day 's pay thanks to this this
time machine .
the light flash and the dish spin , you wan na try it ?
no ! i do n't want to try it , my god , you be grown men , how could you waste your life with these stupid toy and costume and comic book and and now that that
again , time machine .
oh please , it 's not a time machine , if anything it look like something elton john would drive through the everglades .
it only move in time . it would be bad than useless in a swamp .
pathetic . all of you , completely pathetic .
my turn !
so ?
so it 's my turn . why do you set it for the day before yesterday ?
same paradox . if you be to travel back in time and , say , knock me unconscious , you would not then have the conversation that irritated you , motivate you to go back and knock me unconscious .
what if i knock you unconscious right now ?
it wo n't change the past .
but it would make the present so much nicer .
be you upset about something ?
what be your first clue ?
well , it be a number of thing . first the late hour , then your demeanour seem very low energy , plus your irritability
yes i 'm upset .
oh ! i do n't usually pick up on those thing . good for me .
yeah , good for you .
i do n't know . maybe .
wow , i 'm on fire tonight .
uh , here 's the thing . girl like penny never end up with guy who own time machine .
i disagree . your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine . that failure clearly stand on it own .
those be movie .
well of course they 're movie . be you expect me to come up with an example involve a real life time machine ? that 's absurd .
come on , guy , push .
if i push any harder i 'm go to give birth to my colon .
oh , hey guy .
uh , hi penny . take a break , guy !
what be you do ?
oh , just , you know , move a time machine .
yeah , okay , neat , but i really get to get to work , so .
no problem . hang on .
but , what about your time machine .
some thing be more important than toy .
oh , i 'm scar .
do n't worry baby , i 've get you .
oh , leonard .
what be you do ?
i 'm pack up all my collectible and take them down to the comic book store to sell .
well be that really necessary . if you need money you can always sell blood . and semen .
it 's not about money .
we brought food .
lox and bagel , the breakfast of time traveller .
terrific , do anyone want to buy my share of the time machine ?
why ?
because i do n't want it any more .
why ?
just personal reason .
my spidey-sense tell me this have something to do with penny .
look , do you want to buy me out or not ?
screw his balcony , i 'll give you a hundred and twenty and we 'll put it in my garage .
i paid two hundred dollar for my share .
dude , everyone know a time machine loses half it value the minute you drive it off the lot .
i 'll go for two hundred , that time machine stay right where it be .
three hundred , and i 'll throw in my original _ mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effect .
no , no more toy or action figure or prop or replica or costume or robot or darth vader voice changer , i 'm get rid of all of it .
you ca n't do that , look what you 've create here , it 's like nerdvana .
more importantly , you 've a darth vader voice changer ?
not for long .
oh , i call dibs on the golden age flash .
hang on , i need that to complete my justice society of america collection .
too bad , i call dibs .
well you ca n't just call dibs .

why larry ? do larry call dibs ?
will you forget dibs !
he offer me a fair price for the whole collection .
what 's the number , i 'll match it .
i 'll match it , plus a thousand rupee .
what 's the exchange rate .
none of your business . take it or leave it .

okay , okay look , if this be about yesterday , leonard , i be really sorry about what i say , i be just a bit upset .
no you do n't . look , you be a great guy , and it be thing you love that make you who you be .

they call me a genius because i 'm a genius . tell mom that i currently weigh _ pound , and that i 'm have regular bowel movement . enjoy the wedding , goodbye .
woah , woah .
oh , i do n't think so . shelly do n't like company . even a a little boy he 'd send his imaginary friend home at the end of the day .
they be not friend , they be imaginary colleague .
look , you 're here , we have plenty of room .
no we do n't .
come on , shelly , she 's family .
well it would be nice not to have to drive out to anaheim in rush hour .
and do n't ever call me shelly .
so it 's settle . you 'll stay with u .
i 'll walk you to your car . you 're in structure _ level c , right ?
so anyway , we 're eight year old , and sheldon convert my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace .
hee-hee , just classic .
he be try to build some kind of arm robot to keep me out of his room .
anyway , i go to make those little corn muffin they give you , there 's a big flash , next thing you know my eyebrow be go .
yep . i have to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrow my mom drew on .
be that what that be ? i just assume that the second grade curriculum have render you quizzical .
hey , leonard , you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs .
those be not mine .
hi .
wow , you do n't look that much alike .
can i get a hallelujah .
fraternal twin come from two separate egg , they be no more alike than any other sibling .
hallelujah .
hey , guess what . i 've be accepted a a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness .
hey , good for you , raj .
yes , i 'm very hopeful . hello missy . they mention there may be side effect .
well , there 's dr patel at our church .
ah yes , dr patel , good man .
do you like motorcycle , ‘ co i ride a hog .
a hog ? you have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front .
you still have to wear a helmet .
the sex book ?
the indian sex book . in other word if you wonder wonder who write the book of love , it be u .
hey , sheldon 's sister 's pretty cute , i w .
i be n't star !
i do n't say you be , i just say she be cute .
oh . huh , um , maybe , if you like woman who be tall and perfect .
sheldon , why be you ignore your sister ?
i 'm not ignore my sister . i 'm ignore all of you .
oh my ! gherkin and .
oh .
we do n't entertain much .
i guess .
we indian invent them . you 're welcome .
god yes . thanks .
bye guy .
bye missy .
bye missy , see you .
uh , yeah , no , uh , bye penny .
why should i back off , you back off dude .
so what , you 've already get penny .
how do i have penny ? in what universe do i have penny ?
hell , no !
excuse me , can i interject something . i 'm order pizza online , be everyone okay with pepperoni ?
sheldon , can i talk to you in private ?
i guess . do n't worry , i be go to order you cheeseless .
thank you .
i 'm a fancy indian man , we invent pajama !
hey , look at me , i do n't have a foreskin .
sheldon , be you aware that your sister be an incredibly attractive woman ?
hmmm ? she certainly have the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable . it 's noteworth that at other point in history , heavier woman be the standard for beauty because their girth suggest affluence .
that 's fascinate , but i
i do n't say it be fascinate , i say it be noteworthy .
oh . okay . you know , i do n't want to criticise your rhetorical style but , we 'd be a lot far along in this conversation if you 'd begin with that thought .
that 's great , but i .
what i 'm say be that we take quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis .
whatever . you have to do something about it .
why ?
because she 's your sister .
i do n't understand . yes , we share a uterus for nine month , but since then we 've pretty much go our own separate way .
okay , uh . oh , consider this . with your father go , it be your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate .
i have n't consider that . we do share dna .
uh-huh .
so there be the possibility , however remote , that rest in her loin be the potential for another individual a remarkable a myself .
exactly . and , you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister 's future offspring .
you 're right . if someone want to get at missy 's fallopian tube , they 'll have to go through me .
i 'm warn you , i be judo champion at math camp .
alright , that 's enough juvenile squabble , stop it , stop it i say . i 'm go to settle this right now . neither of you be good enough for my sister .
who be you to decide that ?
he 's the man of his family , you have to respect his wish .
you 're out too , by the way .
say what ?
it 's nothing personal , i 'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew do n't become flatulent every time they eat an eskimo pie .
what be you so happy about ?
i 'm not happy , it 's the medication , i ca n't stop smile .
now that leonard 's make me aware of how high the genetic stake be , we have to face the fact that none of you be suitable mate for my sister .
wait a minute . leonard make you aware of that ?
we all make mistake , let 's move on .
excuse me , but i think you 're miss a big opportunity here .
how so ?
everybody know genetic diversity produce the strong offspring . why not put a little mocha in the family latte .
in principle you have a point , but a a practical matter , need i remind you that it take experimental pharmaceutical to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex .
be it ‘ cause i 'm jewish , ‘ cause i 'd kill my rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister .
this have nothing to do with religion . this have to do with the fact that you 're a tiny , tiny man who still life with his mother .
sheldon , you be really be unreasonable .
oh really ?
shelly , can i speak to you for a minute ? alone ?
why do everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone ? usually nobody want to be alone with me .
okay . i 'm not even go to ask why you 're pimp me out for cheese . but since when do you care at all about who i sleep with ?
what on earth be you talk about ?
and what do you mean , mediocre stock ?
sheldon _ ?
you have get to be kid me !
go on .
you donate egg . we will place them in cryogenic storage . i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your egg , have them fertilize and implant in you , that way everybody win .
correction . missy can date whoever she want .
look , we have to settle this .
i agree . sheldon 's sister be hiding at penny 's because we 've all be hit on her at the same time .
she 's not hiding . she need privacy to call her grandmother who 's apparently very sick . oh , and then i believe she have to wash her hair .
do n't start with me dude .
you want to go again ? let 's go .
sit down .
okay .
if we 're go to fight over missy , let 's do it the right way . the honourable way .
and he 's down !
come on , come on , get up .
stay down , bitch . yeah , ha ha , natural selection at work .
i weep for humanity .
ah , hey leonard .
uh , pretty much , why ?
hi , leonard , what 's up ?
that 's so sweet . but no thanks .
no .
um , here 's something we do n't anticipate .
what do you want , howard ?
i 'm fine , thanks for ask . i 've come to call on missy .
hi howard .
not really . no .
no .
okay .
missy ?
thank you . i apprec . apprec . appreeee . oh-oh .
any news you want me to pas along to mom ?
yeah , i 'll just tell her you say hey .
come on , shelly . i want you to know i 'm very proud of you .
yup , i 'm always bragging to my friend about my brother the rocket scientist .
well yeah .
what 's the difference ?
goodbye shelly .
my god ! why do n't you just tell them i 'm a toll taker at the golden gate bridge ? rocket scientist , how humiliate .
hey , guy , guy , some of the other waitress want me to ask you something .
oh , it 's call trestling .
it combine the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetri into the ultimate sport .
yeah , that 's terrific , but what they want me to ask you be to cut it the hell out . right come on guy , come on . happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you
we might a well stop , it 's a stalemate . you 're beating me in tetri , but you 've get the upper body strength of a keebler elf .
keebler elf ? i 've get your keebler elf right here . okay , it 's a stalemate .
he ca n't eat cheesecake , he 's lactose intolerant .
okay , he can have carrot cake .
what about the cream cheese frost .
forget about the cake , how do you know that my birthday be saturday ?
i do your horoscope , remember , i be go to do everybody 's until sheldon go on one of his typical psychotic rant .
for the record , that psychotic rant be a concise summation of the research of bertram forer , who in _ prove conclusively through meticulously design experiment , that astrology be nothing but pseudo scientific hokum .
blah blah blah , a typical taurus . so , seriously , be we go to see you saturday ?
oh , i do n't think so .
why not ?
i do n't celebrate my birthday .
shuddup , yeah you do .
no , it 's no big deal , it 's just the way i be raise . my parent focus on celebrate achievement , and be expel from a birth canal be not consider one of them .
uh , that 's so silly .
it 's actually base on very sound theory , his mother publish a paper on it .
it be obviously effective , leonard grow up to be an experimental physicist . perhaps if she 'd also deny him christmas he 'd be a little well at it .
thank you .
well i love birthday , wake up to mom 's special french toast breakfast , wear the birthday king crown , play laser tag with all my friend .
yeah , see , that 's what kid should have .
actually that be last year .
and ?
uh , it turn out my grandfather have die .
oh my god , that 's terrible .
oh , it be kind of like a birthday party . i get to see all my cousin and there be cake , so
that 's the saddest thing i 've ever heard .
you think ? go ahead , tell her about your senior prom .
howard , every thai restaurant in town know you ca n't eat peanut . they see me come they go “ ah , no peanut boy ! ”
hello penny . leonard just left .
i know . i want to talk to you .
what would we talk about ? we 've no overlap area of interest i 'm aware of , and you know i do n't care for chit-chat .
okay , can you just let me in .
well alright , but i do n't see this a a promising endeavour .
okay , here 's the deal , we be go to throw leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday .
i hardly think so , leonard make it very clear he do n't want a party .
he just do n't know he want one because he 's never have one .
i suppose that 's possible , but for the record , i 've never have a threesome and yet i still know i want one .
howard , here 's the difference . the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freeze over .
fine . if i do have a threesome , you ca n't be part of it . i 'm just kid , yes you can . can you bring a friend ?
i think a birthday party be a terrible idea . i envy leonard for grow up without that anguish .
okay , sweetie , i understand you have scar that no non-professional can heal , but nevertheless we be go to throw leonard a birthday party .
have i point out that i be extremely uncomfortable with dance , loud music and most other form of alcohol induced frivolity .
nevertheless we be .
sheldon , do you understand the concept of blackmail ?
well of course i oh ! yeah , i have an idea , let 's throw leonard a kick as birthday party .
that 's not the secret knock . this be the secret knock .
what difference do it make ?
the whole point of a secret knock be to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one 's co-conspirators .
be that raj and howard ?
possibly , but unverified .
can you just let u in .
luckily for you this be not a nuclear reactor .
so , what do you get the birthday boy ?
well , raj get him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture base on alex ross 's definitive batman , and i get him this amaze autograph copy of the feynman lecture on physic .
nice . i get him a sweater .
okay , well , he might like that , i 've see him chilly .
uh , sheldon , i do n't see your present .
that 's because i do n't bring one .
well why not ?
do n't ask .
the entire institution of gift give make no sense .
told you not to ask .
well , sheldon , you 're his friend . friend give each other present .
i accept your premise , i reject your conclusion .
try tell him it 's a non-optional social convention .
just do it .
oh . fair enough .
no problem .
and then raj , you bring the stuff across the hall and start set up .
what if guest show up ?
entertain them .
what if they 're woman ?
hey !
hey .
how 's it go ?
fine .
so , listen , the new art be show the revise definitive cut of blade runner .
see it .
no , you 've see the 25th anniversary final cut . this one have eight second of previously unseen footage . they say it completely change the tone of the film .
oh . pas .
come on , afterwards there 's a q & a with harrison ford 's body double .
look , i be in the halo battle of my life here , there 's this kid in copenhagen , he have no immune system so all he do be sit in his bubble and play halo _ .
ca n't you play him some other time ?
not if you believe his doctor .
oh my god , do you smell gas .
no .
yeah , no .
alright , you know they have dvd over there .
yes , but they have dvd burner over here . leonard need a dvd burner .
sheldon , a gift should n't be something someone need , it should be something fun , you know , something they would n't buy for themselves .
you mean , like a sweater ?
well , it 's a fun sweater , it 's get a bold geometric print .
be it the geometry that make it fun .
okay , the point be , one of the way we show we care about people be by put thought and imagination into the gift we give them .
okay , i see , so not a dvd burner .
exactly .
something he would n't buy for himself . something fun . something like oh , an 802.11n wireless router .
here you go , copenhagen boy , how about a taste of han christian hand grenade . come on , come on , oh you clever little . come on , come on , take that !
oh-oh . oh-oh !
what 's the matter ?
this granola bar , there 's peanut in it .
oh my god , why do you eat it ?
well if i have a gun there , would you have shot yourself ?
do n't yell at me , i 've get to go to the emergency room .
now ?
no , after my tongue have swollen to the size of a brisket .
alright , let 's go .
what do you think .
um , that one .
because of the two additional ethernet port .
sure .
he do n't need them , he 's already get a _ connect switch
oh , okay then this one .
why ?
i do n't know , the man on the box look so happy .
penny ! if i 'm go to buy leonard a gift , i 'm go to do it right . i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i do .
oh , i know i 'm go to regret this but , what trauma ?
on my twelfth birthday i really want a titanium centrifuge , so , you know , i could separate radioactive isotope .
of course .
instead of a titanium centrifuge , my parent bought me wow , this be hard . they get me a motorise dirt bike .
no ?
what twelve year old boy want a motorise dirt bike ?
all of them .

yeah .
huh ?

penny , look , i 've get a problem .
you have to , we all have to be there at the same time to yell “ surprise ! ”
leonard 's fine . i 'm fine , thanks for ask , by the way .
okay , i do n't need your attitude , just hold him there a little longer .
look , i 've do my best but he want to go home and i do n't know how to stop him .
okay , how about this . you keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party i 'll point out which of my friend be easy .
thy will be do . i 'm do this for you , little buddy .
okay , we do n't have that in stock , but i can special order it for you .
excuse me , sir , you do n't work here .
yes , well , apparently neither do anyone else .
sheldon , we have to go .
why ?
well , for one thing , we 're late for leonard 's birthday party . and for another , i told him to call security .
yeah , _ be not a secure password .
no he 's not .
code _ , i need a gurney , right away , right away .
fank-u .
say what you will about the healthcare system in this country , but when they 're afraid of lawsuit they sure test everything .
i really do n't think the colonoscopy be necessary .
you know , before you get all swollen up , i actually thought you be try to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party .
oh , right , it 's your birthday , i have no idea it be your birthday , i completely forgot , wow , what a lousy way to spend a birthday , well it 's all over now .
there be a party , be n't there .
maybe .
howard .
be you mad ?
how could i be mad ? you actually risk your life because you care about me .
yeah , that 's why i do it .
alright . here we go . my first birthday party .
that 's my friend carol . remind me , i 've get to introduce her to howard .
oh sweet krishna , shake it , that-a rupee maker .
i 'm so sorry you do n't get your party .
oh , it 's okay .
happy birthday anyways .
hey penny , when , uh , when 's your birthday ?
wo de zhing shi sheldon .
wo de ming zi shi sheldon .
what 's this ?
that 's what you do . i assume a in a number of language that the gesture be part of the phrase .
well it 's not .
how be i suppose to know that ? a the teacher it 's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasy from the subject matter .
you know , i 'm really glad you decide to learn mandarin .
hey !
mai du lui tsa .
you just call leonard a syphilitic donkey .
my apology leonard , i 'm only a good a my teacher .
i believe the szechuan palace have be passing off orange chicken a tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them .
i need to use your window .
hey jerkface , you forgot your ipod !
what 's go on ?
okay , where be we ?
not now , i have a blog to find .
penny , be you okay ?
i 'm fine , leonard , just go away .
look , i understand that break up with someone can be very painful .
go away !
hey , look , i found an ipod .
it 's smash beyond repair , what be you go to do with it ?
it be penny 's boyfriend 's , they broke up .
apparently he post intimate detail of their physical relationship on his blog , which i can not find anywhere .
you know what , i 'm go to go back and try talk to her again .
good idea . sit with her , hold her , comfort her , and if the moment feel right , see if you can cop a feel .
i 'm not go to do that , howard .
i 'm not aware of any social convention that require you to intervene at all .
what about “ damsel in distress ? ”
twelfth century code of chivalry , not exactly current . you 'd also have to be knight for that to apply .
i do n't care . she 's upset , i 'm go over there .
remember to sit on your hand a bit so they 're warm .
i 'm her friend , i 'm not go to take advantage of her vulnerability .
what , so you 're say that if in the depth of despair she throw herself at you and demand you take her , right there , right now , you 'll just walk away ?
hey , listen , i know you say that you do n't want to talk
i do n't .
sorry .
wait .
wait , do you say wait ?
tell me the truth . be i just an idiot who pick giant loser ?
no . no .
okay , so i pick good guy , but turn them into loser .
of course not .
well , it 's get to be one or the other , which be it ?
i 'm sorry , what be the choice again ?
i really thought mike be different , i thought he be sensitive and smart . i mean , not you smart , normal non-freaky smart .
yeah , no , sure .
you know , and then he just go and have to humiliate me by write about me on his blog so the entire world can read it .
actually it 's not all that easy to find .
yeah , really , well my friend at work found it , my sister found it , judging by my email a number of prisoner at the michigan state penitentiary found it .
okay , well , you know , this be n't that bad . it just paint the picture of a very affectionate woman who 's open to express her affection in non traditional locale .
elevator , park , movie theatre , out of curiosity , be this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop ?
sandwich shop .
do n't that violate the health code ?
no , at the sub shop we be only make out .
huh . okay . but my point be that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrass .
really , do you think i overreact ?
maybe a little .
‘ cause i do that , i do overreact . maybe i should call mike and apologise .
no . no , no , that , that would be underreacting . he do break the imply confidentiality of the bedroom and , in your case , the elevator , park and fast food franchise .
yes . you 're right . i should just say i 'm do with him .
yes , you should , go ahead , say it .
what be there to explain , it 's all right here , it 's a betrayal .
i 'm pretty sure i never say that .
no , you do well than that , you help me see it on my own .
aw , good for me . where be you go ?
i 'm go over to mike 's . leonard , thank you so much .
oh , sure . huh , maybe i be her gay friend .
i like tangerine chicken , i 'm not get tangerine chicken .
can we please change the subject .
sure . tell u again how you screw up and get penny back together with her old boyfriend .
just roll the dice .
enslave by warlock , stay here till you roll _ , _ or _
she be mad at him . she be do with him , the relationship be broken beyond repair and i walk over there and i fix it !
boy , that story get well every time you hear it .
actually , i thought the first two rendition be far more compelling . previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character , now i just find him to be whiny and annoy .
just eat your tangerine chicken .
i 'd love to , but i do n't have tangerine chicken .
incredible . you manage to screw up the screw-up .
i 'm back .
what happen ?
well , i go over to mike 's to make up with him .
yeah , i know , i know that part .
but he have already move on .
already , that be quick .
oh , penny , i be so sorry .
how could he do that .
oh , well , you know , you do throw an _ gig ipod yeah , no , how could he do that .
i swear to god , i be do with guy like that . you know , macho , with the perfect body and the hair , and the money .
yeah , that must get old quick .
you know , just once , i would like to go out with someone who be nice , and honest , and who actually care about me .
what about you what ?
what about if you go out with me ?
be you ask me out ?
um yes i be ask you out .
wow .
i be just go off your comment about the nice guy
no , i know , i get that . yeah , totally .
…thing and honest but , it 's no big deal
yes .
yes what ?
yes , i will go out with you .
really ?
yeah . why not , i mean , what do i have to lose ?
yeah . that 's the spirit .
sheldon .
aieee ya ! xia si wo le .
i 'm sorry . look , do you have a second .
a second what ? pair of underwear ?
i be just wonder if i could talk to you ? it 's about leonard .
well , raj ca n't talk to me unless he 's drunk , and wolowitz be , you know , disgust .
yes , i suppose he be .
leonard might come home , can we talk in my apartment .
we 're not do ?
no .
ach , why not ? we 're already through the look glass anyway .
okay , so , here 's the thing . i guess you 're aware that leonard ask me out .
oh , that 's nice . anyhow , the thing i want to talk to you about be , you know , since leonard and i have become friend , i be just want to sit down ?
oh , i wish it be that simple . you see , i do n't spend much time here and so i 've never really chosen a place to sit .
well , choose .
there be a number of option and , i 'm really not familiar enough with the cushion density , air flow pattern and dispersion of sunlight to make an inform choice .
alright , why do n't you just pick one at random , and then if you do n't like it you can sit somewhere else next time .
okay . um , here 's the thing . so , i 've know for a while now that leonard have have a little crush on me
a little crush ? well i suppose so , in the same way menelaus have a little crush on helen of troy .
alright , yeah , i do n't really know who they be
well menelaus be the brother of agamemnon
yeah , i do n't care , i do n't care . the point be leonard be n't the kind of guy i usually go out with .
no . what i 'm say be , leonard might be different in a good way . obviously my usual choice have not work out so well .
i would not say that . no-one would say that , a light year be a unit of distance , not time .
thank you for the clarification .
draft . you see people hear the word year and they think duration . foot pound have the same problem , that 's a unit of work , not of weight .
right , thanks .
it 's a common mistake .
not the first one i 've make today .
okay . i think this will be my seat .
sheldon , do you have anything to say that have anything to do with , you know , what i 'm talk about .
well , let 's see . we might consider schrodinger 's cat .
schrodinger ? be that the woman in 2a ?
no . that 's mr grossinger . and she do n't have a cat , she have a mexican hairless , annoy little animal , yip yip yip yip
i 'm sorry , i do n't get the point .
sheldon , what 's the point ?
just like schrodinger 's cat , your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of a both good and bad . it be only by opening the box that you 'll find out which it be .
okay , so you 're say i should go out with leonard .
no , no , no , no , no , no . let me start again . in _ , erwin schrodinger
two seat right there .
sheldon , i think i 've make a mistake .
i can see that . unless you 're planning on run a marathon , choose both stuff and mash potato be a starch fill redundancy .
no , it 's about penny .
a mistake involve penny ? okay , you 'll have to narrow it down .
i do n't think i can go out with her tonight .
then do n't .
other people would say “ why not ? ”
i 'm go to talk anyway .
i assume you would .
ah , then your meal choice be appropriate . starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion .
right .
you also make a common grammatical mistake , you say nauseous when you meant nauseate . but go on .
you 're not help .
alright , what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion ?
tell me whether or not to go through with the date .
schrodinger 's cat .
wow , that 's brilliant .
you sound surprised . mmm , hou zi shui zai li du .
hi .
hi .
come on in .
thank you . you look very nice .
thank you . so do you .
i make an eight o'clock reservation .
okay , great , listen , um , maybe we should talk first .
oh . okay . but before you say anything , have you ever heard of schrodinger 's cat ?
actually , i 've heard far too much about schrodinger 's cat .
good .
alright , the cat 's alive , let 's go to dinner .
blow your own nose and go away .
crazy man . call the police .
no . do n't call the library . show me your mucus . ox be in my bed ! many , many ox ! oy vey !
there you go , pad thai , no peanut .
but do it have peanut oil ?
uh , i 'm not sure , everyone keep an eye on howard in case he start to swell up .
since it 's not bee season , you can have my epinephrine .
be there any chopstick ?
you do n't need chopstick , this be thai food .
ask him for a napkin , i dare you . i 'll get it .
do i look puffy ? i feel puffy .
hey leonard .
oh , hi penny .
be i interrupt .
no .
you 're not swell , howard .
no , no , look at my finger , they 're like vienna sausage .
sound like you have company .
they 're not go anywhere . so , you 're come home from work . that 's great . how be work .
well , you know , it 's the cheesecake factory . people order cheesecake , and i bring it to them .
so , you sort of act a a carbohydrate delivery system .
yeah , call it whatever you want , i get minimum wage . yeah , anyways , i be wonder if you could help me out with something , i be .
yes .
oh . okay , great , i 'm have some furniture deliver tomorrow , and i may not be here , so . oh ! hel…hello !
i 'm sorry ?
have n't you ever be told how beautiful you be in flawless russian ?
no , i have n't .
get use to it .
yeah , i probably wo n't , but hey sheldon .
hi .
hey raj ! still not talk to me , huh ?
do n't take it personally , it 's his pathology , he ca n't talk to woman .
he ca n't talk to attractive woman , or in your case a cheesecake-scented goddess !
so , there 's gon na be some furniture deliver ?
yeah , yeah , if it get here and i 'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment .
great , here 's my spare key . thank you .
penny , wait .
yeah ?
um , if you do n't have any other plan , do you want to join u for thai food and a superman movie marathon ?
a marathon ? wow , how many superman movie be there ?
you 're kid , right ?
yeah , i do like the one where lois lane fall from the helicopter and superman swoosh down and catch her , which one be that ?
one . .
you realise that scene be rife with scientific inaccuracy .
yeah , and you do n't have a problem with that , how do he fly at night .
uh , a combination of the moon 's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cell .
i 'm just go to go wash up .
i have _ hundred comic book in there , i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cell .
challenge accepted . we 're lock out .
i hardly think so .
why not ?
archimedes would be so proud .
do you have any idea ?
yes , but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring .
easy , easy okay ! now we 've get an inclined plane . the force require to lift be reduce by the sine of the angle of the stair , call it thirty degree , so about half .
exactly half .
exactly half . let 's push . okay , see , it 's move , this be easy , all in the math .
what 's your formula for the corner .
what ? oh , okay , uh , okay , yeah , no problem , just come up here and help me pull and turn .
ah , gravity , thou art a heartless bitch .
you do understand that our effort here will in no way increase the odds of you have sexual congress with this woman ?
men do thing for woman without expect sex .
yeah , those be men who just have sex .
almost there , almost there , almost there .
no we 're not , no we 're not , no we 're not .
watch your finger . watch your finger . oh god , my finger !
you okay ?
no , it hurt great caesar 's ghost , look at this place ?
do it ever occur to you that not everyone have the compulsive need to sort , organise and label the entire world around them ?
no .
well they do n't . hard a it may be for you to believe , most people do n't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content .
excuse me , but i think we 've both found that helpful at time .
come on , we should go .
hang on .
what be you do ?
straighten up .
sheldon , this be not your home .
this be not anyone 's home , this be a swirl vortex of entropy .
when the transvestite live here , you do n't care how he kept the place .
because it be immaculate , i mean , you open that man 's closet , it be left to right , even gown , cocktail dress , then his police uniform .
what be you do in his closet ?
i help run some cable for a webcam .
hey guy .
oh , hey penny , this just arrive , we just brought this up , just now .
great . be it hard get it up the stair ?
no .
no ?
no .
no .
well , we 'll get out of your hair .
oh , great , thank you again .
penny , i just want you to know that , you do n't have to live like this . i 'm here for you .
what 's he talk about ?
it 's a joke .
i do n't get it .
yeah , he do n't tell it right .
sheldon ?
sheldon ? hello ?
sheldon !
sssshhhh ! penny 's sleep .
be you insane , you ca n't just break into a woman 's apartment in the middle of the night and clean .
i have no choice . i could n't sleep know that just outside my bedroom be our living room , and just outside our living room be that hallway , and immediately adjacent to that hallway be this .
do you realise that if penny wake up , there be no reasonable explanation a to why we 're here ?
i just give you a reasonable explanation .
no , no . you give me an explanation , it 's reasonableness will be determine by a jury of your peer .
do n't be ridiculous . i have no peer .
sheldon , we have to get out of here .
you might want to speak in a low register .
what ?
evolution have make woman sensitive to high pitch noise while they sleep , so that they 'll be rouse by a cry baby . if you want to avoid wake her , speak in a low register .
that 's ridiculous .
no , that 's ridiculous .
i be not leave until i 'm do .
o-o-o-oh ! .
if you have time to lean , you have time to clean .
oh , what the hell .
morning .
morning .
i have to say , i slept splendidly . grant , not long , but just deeply and well .
sarcasm ?
you think ?
grant , my method may have be somewhat unorthodox , but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny 's quality of life .
you know what , you 've convince me , maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet .
you do n't think that cross a line ?
yes ! for god 's sake , sheldon , do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth .

how about liquid coolant ? maybe a little aquarium pump here , run some quarter inch pvc

hold on , honey , men at work . the pvc come down here , maybe a little corrugate sheet metal a a radiator here .
and if water be involve we 're go to have to ground the crap out of the thing .
guy , it 's hot in here , i think i 'll just take off all my clothes .

kiss , what kind of kiss ? cheek ? lip ? chaste ? french ?
what be wrong with you ?
i 'm a romantic .
please do n't tell me that your hopeless infatuation be devolve into pointless jealousy .
no , i 'm not jealous , i 'm just a little concerned for her . i do n't like the look of the guy that she be with .
well , at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twist smoulder wreckage that be once your fantasy of date her , and analyse the data so that you do n't crash into geek mountain again .
i disagree , love be not a sprint , it 's a marathon . a relentless pursuit that only end when she fall into your arm . or hit you with the pepper spray .
well , i 'm do with penny . i 'm go to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed .
like who ?
i do n't know . olivia geiger ?
the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye ?
i do n't know , you guy work in the same lab .

there be pitfall , trust me , i know . when it come to sexual harassment law i'm a bit of a self-taught expert .
look , howard , if i be to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner , i 'm not go to walk into the lab , ask her to strip naked and dance for me .
oh , then you 're probably okay .
hi leonard .
goggles , leonard .
hang on . i 'm try to see how long it take a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o ' noodle .
wait , be you ask me out ?
interest . and would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be base on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss .
well , why do n't we just stipulate that the date go well and move to the key variable .
yes .
close mouth but romantic . mint ?
what do you think .
fair enough . on the plus side , it be a good kiss , reasonable technique , no extraneous spittle . on the other hand , no arousal .
none .
thank you .
none at all ?
sheldon , if you be a robot , and i knew and you do n't , would you want me to tell you ?
that depends . when i learn that i 'm a robot , will i be able to handle it ?
maybe , although the history of science-fiction be not on your side .
uh , let me ask you this . when i learn that i 'm a robot , would i be bound by asimov 's three law of robotics ?
you might be bound by them right now .
that 's true . have you ever harm a human be , or through inaction allow a human be to come to harm ?
of course not .
have you ever harm yourself , or allow yourself to be harm except in case where a human be would have be endanger ?
well , no .

oh , oh that 's too bad . well hey , do n't worry , i 'm sure there be someone out there who be just right for you . .
well what do she mean by that ? be that just a generic platitude or be that a subtle bid for attention ?

i 'm peter pan ! and i 've get a handful of pixie dust with your name on it .
no you do n't . oh , hey , what 's sheldon suppose to be .
oh , he 's the doppler effect .
yes . it 's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave cause by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer .
oh , sure , i see it now , the doppler effect . alright , i 've get to shower , you guy um , make yourselves comfortable .
okay .
see , people get it .
mmmm , by odin 's beard , this be good chex mix .
no thanks , peanut , i ca n't afford to swell up in these tights .
i 'm confuse . if there 's no costume parade , what be we do here ?
we 're socialise . meeting new people .
telepathically ?
oh hey , when do you get here , hi !
penny be wear the bad catwoman costume i have ever see , and that include halle berry 's .
she 's not catwoman , she 's just a generic cat .
and that 's the kind of sloppy costume which result from a lack of rule and competition .
hey guy , check out the sexy nurse . i believe it 's time for me to turn my head and cough .
what be your move ?
i 'm go to use the mirror technique . she brush her hair back , i brush my hair back , she shrug , i shrug , subconsciously she 's think we 're in sync , we belong together .
where do you get this stuff ?
you know , psychology journal , internet research , and there 's this great show on vh about how to pick up girl .
oh , if only i have his confidence . i have such difficulty speak to woman . or around woman . or at time , even effeminate men .
no thanks .
no , seriously , you can , i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia .
i want to get to know penny 's friend , i just , i do n't know how to talk to these people .
well , i actually might be able to help .
like jane goodall observe the ape , i initially saw their interaction a confuse and unstructured , but pattern emerge , they have their own language if you will .
go on .
then what happens ?
that 's a far a i 've gotten .
this be ridiculous , i 'm jumping in .
good luck .
no , you 're come with me .
oh , i hardly think so .
be n't you afraid i 'll embarrass you ?
yes . but i need a wing-man .
oh , hi !
hi .
so , what be you suppose to be ?
uh , a choo-choo train ?
how waste be i ?
i still do n't get it .
okay , if that be some sort of learn disability , i think it 's very insensitive .
why do n't you just tell people you 're a zebra ?
well , why do n't you just tell people you 're one of the seven dwarf .
because i 'm frodo .
yes , well , i 'm the doppler effect .
what ?
that 's penny 's ex-boyfriend .
what do you suppose he 's do here ? besides disrupt the local gravity field .
if he be any big , he 'd have moon orbit him .
oh , snap . so i guess we 'll be leave now .
why should we leave ? for all we know , he crashed the party and penny do n't even want him here . .
you have a back-up hypothesis .
maybe they just want to be friend .
then he and i be on equal ground .
yes , but you 're much closer to it than he be .
look , if this be _ year ago , by virtue of his size and strength , kurt would be entitle to his choice of female partner .
and male partner . animal partner . large primordial eggplant , pretty much whatever tickle his fancy .
yes , but our society have undergone a paradigm shift , in the information age , sheldon , you and i be the alpha male . we should n't have to back down .
true . why do n't you text him that and see if he back down ?
no . i 'm go to assert my dominance face to face .
face to face ? be you go to wait for him to sit down , or be you go to stand on a coffee table ?
hello penny . hello kurt .
oh , hey guy . you have a good time ?
and what be you suppose to be , an elf ?
what 's the difference ?
so why the hell would you want to be a hobbit ?
well , whatever , why do n't you go hop off on a quest , i 'm talk to penny here .
i think we 're all talk to penny here .
okay , maybe you do n't hear me , go away .
aw , i be be nice . right little buddy .

okay , now you 're start to make me mad .
what ?
yeah , how about i make a point out of your pointy little head .
let me remind you , while my moral support be absolute , in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless .
c - o - n frontation !

fine . you 're one lucky little leprechaun .
he 's a hobbit ! i 've get your back .
leonard , be you okay .
oh , okay , alright , well thank you for come .

be you sure that your be drunk , and your be angry with kurt do n't have something to do with what 's go on here ?
it might . boy , you 're really smart .
because if all guy be like me , the human race could n't survive .
i should probably go .
probably .
thank you .
that 's right , you saw what you saw . that 's how we roll in the shire .
come .
he 's not here . maybe the avenger summon him .
he 's not the marvel comic story , he 's the original norse god .
thank you for the clarification .
i 'm suppose to give him a ride home .
wow , i have to say , you be an amaze man . you 're gentle and passionate , and my god , you be such a good listener !
do you say , call helen boxleitner ?
no . call leonard hofstadter .
do you say , call temple beth sader .
no .
here , let me try . call mcflono mcfloonyloo . heh-heh .
call rajesh koothrappali . .
oh , that 's very impressive . and a little racist .
if we 're all through play mock the flaw technology , can we get on with halo night , we be suppose to start at eight , it be now _ .
so ? we 'll start now .
yes , first we have to decide if those lose six minute will be come out of game time , bathroom time or the pizza break .
we can split it two , two and two .
if we 're have anchovy on the pizza we ca n't take it out of bathroom time .
hey guy .
see a penny , pick her up , and all the day you 'll have good luck .
well , be she do it one thong at a time , or do she just throw it all in , like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse .
he really need to dial it down .
so , if you do n't like this christie , why be you let her stay ?
well , she be engage to my cousin while she be sleep with my brother , so she 's kind of family .
you know , i apologise for my earlier outburst , who need halo when we can be regale with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha ?
oh , i do n't think she 's a whore .
no , yeah she 's definitely a whore . i mean , she have absolutely no standard , this one time , she be at where 's howard ?
bonjour mademoiselle , i understand you 're new in town .
oh good grief .
ugh , i can not believe christie let howard into my apartment .
and i can not believe people pay for horoscope , but on a more serious note it 's _ and we 're still not play halo .
one on one ? we do n't play one on one , we play team , not one on one . one on one !
well the only way we can play team at this point be if we cut raj in half .
oh , sure , cut the foreigner in half , there 's a billion more where he come from .
hey , if you guy need a fourth , i 'll play .
great idea .
uh , no . the wheel be a great idea . relativity be a great idea . this be a notion , and a rather sucky one at that .
why ?
why ? oh , penny , penny , penny .
oh , what , what , what ?
this be a complex battle simulation with a steep learn curve , there be myriad weapon , vehicle and strategy to master , not to mention an extremely intricate back-story .
oh cool , whose head do i just blow off ?
mine .
okay , i get this , lock and load boy .
it 's the only way we can play team .
ha-ha , there go your head again .
okay , this be n't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who 's just respawned , you need to give them a chance to now come on !
raj , raj , she 's get me corner , cover me .
cover this , sucker . ha-ha-ha !
penny , you be on fire .
yeah , so be sheldon .
okay , that 's it , i do n't know how , but she be cheat . no-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game .
wait , wait , sheldon , come back , you forgot something .
what ?
you laugh now , you just wait until you need tech support .
gosh , he 's kind of a sore loser , be n't he ?
well , to be fair , he be also a rather unpleasant winner .
well , it 's be fun .
you know , penny , we make such a good team , maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournament sometime .
or we could just have a life .
i guess for you that 's an option .
good night , leonard .
good night .
a usual , nice talk to you raj
what do you suppose she meant by that ?
she 's an enigma , raj .
and another thing , there 's a certain ethic to the game , penny , a well estab
she 's go , sheldon .
well she could have say goodbye .
okay , i have a problem .
it 's call carpal tunnel syndrome , and quite frankly you deserve it .
what 's wrong ?
um , well , howard and christie be kind of hook up in my bedroom .
look , i grow up on a farm , okay , from what i heard they 're either have sex or howard 's caught in a milk machine . do you mind if i stay here tonight ?
no , take the couch , or my bed , i just get new pillow , hypo-allergenics .
uh , the couch be good .
hold that thought , leonard , a moment .
let me guess , you have a problem with this .
where do i begin ?
it 's up to you , crazy person 's choice .
well first , we do n't have house guest , frankly if i could afford the rent i 'd ask you to leave .
well , our earthquake supply , we have a two day , two man kit .
so ?
so , if there be an earthquake and the three of u be trap here , we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon .
i 'm sorry , be you suggest that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism ?
no-one ever think it will happen until it do .
penny , if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bone while we sleep , you can stay .
hu what ?
he 's engage in reductio-ad-absurdum . it 's the logical fallacy of extend someone 's argument to ridiculous proportion and then criticise the result , and i do not appreciate it .
i 'll get you a blanket and a pillow .
okay , well since i 'm obviously be ignore here , let 's go over the morning schedule , i use the bathroom from _ to _ , plan your ablution and bodily function accordingly .
how be i suppose to plan my bodily function ?
i suggest no liquid after 11pm .

thanks leonard .
hmmph , wrong .
i 'm listen .
why ?
it 's culturally universal , a bed , even a temporary bed , be always orient with the headboard away from the door . it serf the ancient imperative of protect oneself against marauder .
i 'll risk it .
hm !
anything else i should know .
yes . if you use my toothbrush i 'll jump out that window . please do n't come to my funeral . have a good night .
sorry about that .

let me walk you through it , our standard be , the steam dumpling appetizer , general so 's chicken , beef with broccoli , shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main . do you see the problem ?
our entire order be predicate on four dumpling and four entree divide among four people .

that work .
no elimination .
if we have extra , we 'll just take the leftover home .
and divide it how , i 'm tell you we can not do this without wolowitz .
wolowitz be with his new girlfriend , if you have let me invite penny then you would have have your fourth .
have you see penny eat chinese food , she us a fork , and she double dip her egg roll .
we do n't order egg roll .
exactly , but we 'd have to if she be here .
can we please make a decision , not only be there child starve in india , there 's an indian starve right here .
here 's an idea , why do n't we just go out for indian food .
i 'll know .
how about soup ?

what about the won-tons ?
it 's halo night .
yeah . okay . so ?

maybe we should have ask if we could go dance with her and her girlfriend .
okay , assume we could dance , which we ca n't , there be three of u and two of them .
so ?
it 's the chinese restaurant all over again . i assure you that cut a dumpling in third be child 's play compare with three men , each attempt to dance with _ % of a woman .
aaah , for god 's sake , sheldon , you be drive me crazy .

you 're not go to put that on your message be you ?
no , i 'm just kid , i 'll re-record it .
sheldon , think this through , you 're go to ask howard to choose between sex and halo .
no , i 'm go to ask him to choose between sex and halo _ . a far a i know , sex have not be upgraded to include high-def graphic and enhance weapon system .
you 're right , all sex have be nudity , orgasm and human contact .
lady , lady , i 'm sure there 's a middle ground .
shut up howard .

it 's up to you dear , we do n't want to meddle .

if i may , your parent probably do n't consider this meddling , while arrange marriage be no longer the norm , indian parent continue to have a great than average involvement in their child 's life .
why be you tell me about my own culture ?
you seem confuse .
bye bye .
i do n't believe it .
neither do i doogie howser 's be off the air for like , twenty year .
actually , i read somewhere that it 's one of the most popular programme in india .
it might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one 's child enter the medical profession .
i bet you 're right .
what 's not to love ?
excuse me , hello ? my parent be try to marry me off to a total stranger , what be i go to do ?
i suggest you go through with it .
what ?
romantic love a the basis for marriage have only exist since the nineteenth century . up until then , arrange marriage be the norm , and it serve society quite well .
it 's the entire premise of fiddler on the roof .
i 'm not a big fan of musical , but i love that show .
me too . of course , it speaks to me culturally .
understandable , but there 's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity .
okay , i know what i 'm go to do .
what ?
find new friend .
so who want to rent fiddler ?
no need , we have the special edition .
oh dear , i be rightly and truly screw .
hey , i thought you be find new friend .
can you believe how pushy she be ?
so do n't call her .
if i do n't call her , i wo n't hear the end of it from my parent .
how can i call her , you know i ca n't talk to woman .
i 'm do , anybody else ?
give me the phone .
why ?
just give it to me .
for what , make me sound like a simpson character ?

i do n't want to make this one .
look on the bright side , she might turn out to be a nice , beautiful girl .
work for my parent .

oh . you know you can just get one of those universal remote at radio shack , they 're really cheap .
no , no , no , you do n't get it , um , howard , enable public access .
public access enable .
boy , that 's brilliant , but i 'll see you .
no , hang on , hang on . see !
no .
someone in sezchuan province , china be use his computer to turn our light on and off .
because we can .
they found the remote control car .
well , wait , wait , what 's on top of them .
wireless webcam , wave hello .
you may want to put on slack .
what ? ew , stop it , no , leave me alone .
who 's run the red corvette ?

you know , in the future , when we 're disembody brain in jar , we 're go to look back on this a eight hour well waste .
i do n't want to be in a jar . i want my brain in an android body . eight foot tall and ripped .
i 'm with you . i just have to make sure if i 'm a synthetic human i 'd still be jewish . i promise my mother .
i suppose you could have your android penis circumcise . but that 's something your rabbi would have to discus with the manufacturer .
not to mention you 'd have to power down on saturday .
sheldon , why be this letter in the trash ?
well , there 's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously form around the letter , but occam 's razor would suggest that someone threw it out .
it 's from the institute for experimental physic . they want u to present our paper on the property of super solid at the topical conference on bowes-einstein condensate .
i know . i read it before i threw it out .
i do n't know , sheldon , those topical conference on bowes-einstein condensate party be legendary .
forget the party .
forget the party ? what a nerd .
be there any other honour i 've gotten that i do n't know about ? do ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it ?
leonard , please do n't take this the wrong way , but the day you win a nobel prize , be the day i begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on fly carpet .
hoo-hoo-hoo . the only thing miss from that insult be “ yo mamma . ”
i 've get one , hey leonard , your mamma 's research methodology be so flaw .
shut up , howard . sheldon , we have to do this .
no we do n't . we have to take in nourishment , expel waste , and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from die , everything else be optional .
okay , let me put it this way , i 'm do it .
you ca n't . i 'm the lead author .
excuse me , i design the experiment that prove the hypothesis .
it do n't need prove .
so the entire scientific community be just suppose to take your word ?
they 're not suppose to , but they should .
alright , i do n't care what you say , i 'm go to the conference and i 'm present our finding .
and i forbid it .
you forbid it ?
if i 'm not take credit for our work then nobody be .
oh , you admit that it 's our work .
no , once again , i 'm throw you a bone . and once again , you be welcome .

so , you know , be n't there maybe some way you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing .
no . no . scientist do not compromise . our mind be train to synthesise fact and come to inarguable conclusion . not to mention , sheldon be batcrap crazy .
oh , careful . that 's my original series battlestar galactica flight suit .
oh , why do n't you wear it at halloween ?
because it 's not a costume , it 's a flight suit .

oh . well , a few year ago he do go out with a woman who have a phd in french literature .
how be that not a braniac ?

do you know any card trick ?
okay , okay , you know , i get it , leonard have no business be involve with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lie to him about finish community college .
why would you lie about that ?

you thought the opposite of stupid loser be community college graduate ?
you know , there be a lot of successful people in this country who be community college graduate .
right , okay look , this be between you and me , you can not tell leonard any of this .
you 're ask me to keep a secret ?
okay , look , if leonard find out that i lie , i will absolutely die of embarrassment .
physiologically impossible .
oh sheldon , please , look , i 'm ask you a a friend .
so you 're say that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidence ?
well , yeah .
i.e , i could n't become green lantern unless i be chosen by the guardian of oa , but give enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility , i could be batman .
you could be batman ?

he told you ?

wow , i get it , because dr leonard hofstadter ca n't date a girl without a fancy college degree .
well , it 's really not that fancy , it 's just a city college .
right , but i have to have some sort of degree to date you ?
that do n't matter to me at all .
so , it 's fine with you if i 'm not smart .
well , you 're the doctor , but i be constantly hearing this annoy sound .
me , too .
be it a high-frequency whistle ?
yup , there 's no inflammation at all , sheldon .
i seriously doubt it .
maybe it 's a linger bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies .
okay , i 'll be right in .
it 's not enough that she mock me , but that be n't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot .
do you understand that stephanie 's not here to treat your imaginary ailment ?
how be it imaginary that i keep hearing an octave above middle c ? be that imaginary ? i do n't think so .

see , my initial approach to kripke , have the same deficiency a those that plague stu the cockatoo , when he be new at the zoo .
yes , he 's new at the zoo .
it 's a terrific book . i 've distil it essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process .
uh-oh , he 's stuck in an infinite loop .
nope , i wan na climb some wocks .

sheldon , be you okay ?
oh yes , i pas out all the time . but , it be worth it . i 've make substantial progress in bonding with kripke , which brings me to an awkward moment .
what 's that ?
maintain five friendship promise to be a herculean task . so , i 'm go to have to let one of you go .
leonard , you be my roommate , my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheet when they come out of the dryer . you be safe .
can i whistle ?
do n't be silly . howard , you do not have a phd , your cologne be an assault on the sens and you 're not available for video game during the jewish high holiday .

he almost make it to the top this time .
hmmm .
the problem appear to be unsolvable .
there be too many variable . it would take forever .
right , these theatre have to be eliminate .
why ? they 're state-of-the-art digital projection , 20-channel surround sound .
yes , but they have no icee machine . despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign , i might add .
what about the multiplex here ? the seat be terrific .
they have twizzlers instead of red vine . no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that .
we could eat after the movie .
unacceptable , the delay would result in tomorrow morning 's bowel movement occur at work .
hang on , hang on . there 's a 7-eleven here . we smuggle slurpies , which be essentially icees , in under our coat , after have a pleasant meal either here , here or here .
wow . i do n't see how we miss that .
excuse me , in what universe be slurpies icees ?
that 's how we miss it .
sheldon , would you be prepared , on a non-precedential basis , to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpie-icee equivalency ?
oh , leonard , you know i ca n't do that .
okay , i guess we only have one option .
yep , i do n't see any way around it .
bye , sheldon .
see ya .
later , dude .
they 're right , it be the only option .
ooh , ooh , shut the door , shut the door .
why ?
well , you do n't specify .
be leonard around ?
he go to the movie without me . it be the only option . i 'm sorry , i do n't understand which social situation this be . could you give me some guidance a to how to proceed ?
the building manager 's show an apartment downstairs , and i have n't paid my rent .
oh , i see . penny , i 'm not sure i 'm comfortable harbour a fugitive from the _ north los roble corporation .
it 's no big deal . i 'm just a little behind on my bill because they cut back my hour at the restaurant and my car broke down .
if you recall , i point out the “ check engine ” light to you several month ago .
well the “ check engine ” light be fine . it 's still blinking away . it 's the stupid engine that stop work . it cost me like twelve hundred dollar to fix it .
you know , it occurs to me you could solve all your problem by obtain more money .
yes , it occurs to me , too .
wow , you get a lot of money in there .
that 's why it 's guard by snake . take some .
do n't be silly .
i 'm never silly . here .
no , i ca n't .
do n't you need money ?
well , yeah , but
this be money i 'm not use .
really ? i mean , be you sure ?
i see no large upcoming expenditure unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like wolverine .
i sincerely hope so .
okay . well , thank you . oh , god , no , i ca n't . sheldon honey , i do n't want thing to be weird between u .
wo n't it also be weird if i have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you 're living in a refrigerator box and wash your hair with rain water ?
i 'll pay you back a soon a i can .
of course you will . it 's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can . assume you subscribe to a linear understand of time and causality .
i 'm regret this already .
you know , i 've give the matter some thought , and i think i 'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent alien .
interest .
ask me why .
do i have to ?
of course . that 's how you move a conversation forward .
why ?
the learn opportunity would be abundant . additionally , i like have my belly scratch .
hey , penny . how be work ?
great . i hope i 'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life .
be that sarcasm ?
no .
be that sarcasm ?
yes .
be that sarca
stop it !
penny , you appear to have a package here .
oh , thanks . this must be the beret i order . a couple of month ago . it be back-ordered .
do you know the beret be an example of piece of woman 's fashion adapt from male military uniform ? another fascinate example be the epaulet .
all right .
oh , my god , would you just get off my case ?
weird .
oh , good , that be an unusual interaction . i be n't sure .
do you guy have an argument ?
no .
well , you clearly do something to aggravate her .
i 'm at a loss . if you like , you can review my daily log of social interaction and see if there 's a blunder i overlook .
here you go . oh , you owe me another two dollar . the price of mu-shu pork go up .
it 's get tougher and tougher to be a bad jew .
here you go , penny . shrimp with lobster sauce .
thank you , leonard . what 's my share ?
do n't worry about it . it 's my treat .
it 's , whatever . ten , eleven dollar .
well , which be it , ten or eleven ?
what ?
he be just wonder if he wore skintight jean and a tank top if he 'd get his shrimp lo mein for free .
yeah , raj , what be you say ?
‘ cause let me tell you something , buddy , i pay my own way in this world , okay ? i do n't rely on anybody ! what be that about ?
he have a nervous bladder when he 's stress out . kind of like a puppy .
here , leonard , ten , eleven , twelve , uh , fourteen dollar .
it be fourteen fifty , but it 's okay .
oh , good . dinner 's here .
yes , dinner 's here , and i 'm have some . i 'm have takeout food .
okay .
forgive me , penny , but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit .
sheldon , look , i will pay you back a soon a i can . you just have to give me more time .
oh , wait , you lent her money ?
where be you go ?
go home , where i wo n't be interrogate like a criminal . i forgot my fortune cookie .
in case either of you have larceny in your heart , you should know that i 've move my money out of the snake can .
but if you 're ever short , there 's always a couple of fifty in green lantern 's as .
hey .
hey .
a little mood light , huh ?
yeah . when i do n't pay my bill , the department of water and power thought i would enjoy the ambience .
yeah , they 're very considerate that way .
fourteen dollar , huh ?
yeah , well , that 's not really my big problem .
so you 're a little behind on your bill . everybody get behind on their bill .
well , what be the plan ?
be there a plan b ?
oh , no , i ca n't give up my act class . i 'm a professional actress .
you 've have an act job where you get paid ?
that be not the definition of professional .
actually , it kind of let 's keep look . whoa , what 's eighteen hundred dollar to the los angeles county superior court ?
oh , that 's nothing .
nothing ? it sound like you get caught speed go _ mile an hour .
well , remember kurt ?
your ex-boyfriend ?
yeah . he get arrest for take a whiz on a cop car .
what ?
he be drunk .
i would hope so .
anyway , he have a bunch of outstanding ticket and a bench warrant , so i , you know , i paid his fine .
do he pay you back ?
no , but he will .
and that 's base on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicle ?
leonard , i 'm not gon na call up kurt and ask him for money .
well what be you gon na do ?
i do n't know , but i may have to find a cheaper place to live .
oh , no . oh , you do n't want to do that .
well , do you know anybody ?
well , i 'm sure the guy living with sheldon would n't mind move in with you .
oh , leonard , honey , if we start living together , i would n't be able to keep my hand off you .
really ?
and you thought my act lesson be a waste of money .
ugh . this mu-shu pork 's burning a hole through my duodenum .
leviticus _ : “ only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beast shall ye eat . ”
hey , what 's go on ?
we 're on a quest through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown .
you want the valley of fire ? it 's right here .
hey , you guy want to go on a real live quest ?
outside ? i just make cocoa .
come on . it 'll be fun .
ooh , double six .
really ? you 're just gon na let me go by myself ?
oh , cool , i get a sword .
i could use some help .
here .
you guy be unbelievable , you play a game to simulate adventure , but when there 's real adventure out there in the real world , you just wimp out .
leonard , do you not recall the last time we visit this gentleman , we return home without pant ?
i do .
be you sure ? because your proposal suggests that you do n't .
i 'm not afraid of him .
all right . leonard fairly call the question , who be in favour of abandon our game and confront penny 's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him ? say hi to kurt for u .
excuse me . when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor , do n't samwise , pippin and merry go with him ?
they do .
well ?
they have a terrible time of it , leonard .
plus , no one stole their pant .
fine . just enjoy your little game . i 'll make this quest on my own .
leonard , wait . take a jacket , it 's spritz a little .
you guy suck . come on , please ? he 's so big .
okay , be everyone clear on the plan ?
yes . koothrappali 's go to wet himself , i 'm gon na throw up , sheldon 's gon na run away , and you 're go to die . shall we synchronize our watch ?
guy , there be four of u and one of him .
which mean his triumph will be even large . minstrel will write song about him .
okay , how about this ? i 'll do the talk , you just stand behind me and try to look formidable .
yeah ?
lenny , right ?
no . what do you want ?
you do n't remember me ? how could he not remember me ?
sheldon , not now .
i remember him .
well , there you go . problem solve .
a successful quest . now let 's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom .
no , the problem be n't solve . he just blew u off .
i 've get it . he do n't remember me because the last time we met i be in a halloween costume .
come on , leonard , let 's go
what happen to your backup ?
i do n't need backup . i have right on my side . and i 'm wear cargo short under my pant .
congratulation . you may not have succeed in get cash , but you do secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt .
maybe we should have your head notarize .
if anybody care , i still have to pee .
hey .
hey , be sheldon here ?
yeah . hang on . sheldon !
nice hat .
it 's kind of a fashionable look these day .
maybe if you 're work on a tuna boat .
hello , penny .
sheldon , here be your money . thank you very much . it help a lot .
sarcasm ?
no .
darn . i ca n't seem to get the hang of that .
yes , he say he be feel guilty and want to do what be right .
that 's it ? do he give any reason a to why he come to this moral epiphany ?
nope . i just think he 's really change . we 're have dinner tomorrow night , and i get to wear my new beret . bye , guy .
bye .
well do , leonard . the true hero do n't seek adulation , he fight for right and justice simply because it 's his nature .
penny 's hook up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and i have indelible ink on my forehead !
that 's your badge of honour , your warrior 's wound , if you will . i be wrong , minstrel will write song about you .
great .
there once be a brave lad name leonard , with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee . he face a fearsome giant , while raj just want to pee .
penny , come on , we be just find our sound .
you found it . it 's the sound of a cat be run over by a lawn mower .
what 's that about ?
not a clue .
no , i do n't realize it have be so long . sure , i guess there 's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it .
he 's refer to an activity he have do before . it 's unpleasant and need to be repeat . this suggests some sort of invasive medical test , like perhaps a colonoscopy .
be n't there any other option ? there 's not a lot of room , it 's gon na be uncomfortable .
yes , yes . yeah , i 'm definitely go with colonoscopy .
okay , bye . my mother 's come to visit .
how about that , you be right .
yes , i can read the sign , i 'm just ponder the implication .
you must be leonard 's mother .
oh , i do n't know if i must be , but yes .
oh , dr beverley hofstadter .
oh , you 're a hand shaker . interest .
oh , all right . would you like to exchange pleasantry on the way ?
all right , you start .
oh , i think you mean young . he 's always be little .
well , that be one of my degree . my primary field be neuroscience .
well , there be study that suggest that many who go into the perform art suffer from an external locus of identity .
well , it mean you value yourself only a others value you , which be often the result of unmet childhood emotional need .
tell me about it .
and then , i 'm assume , you enter adolescence .
if you want to have intercourse with that girl , find out what kind of cologne her father wore .
good to see you , mother .
oolong ?
loose , not bag ?
steep three minute ?
two-percent milk ?
warm separately ?
one teaspoon sugar ?
raw sugar ?
it 's cold .
i 'll start again .
oh , i do n't know where he would 've gotten that . aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage , his father and i only have intercourse for the purpose of reproduction .
yes , we think so . we 've both do paper on it . mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological . mine , of course , be the only one worth reading .
well , it 's all online or you can order it from the princeton university press .
here 's your tea , mother . so , what be you guy talk about ?
the frequency with which your parent have intercourse .
i 'm sorry , it 's on my other laptop .
aw
oh , well , i 've be have some fascinate menopausal symptom recently .
oh . your uncle floyd die .
his heart stop beating . i have to urinate .
what a remarkable woman .
yeah i , i thought you guy might hit it off .
i envy you your childhood .
i hate to tell you , but the only warm memory i have of my childhood be of my uncle floyd .
you 're clearly misremember . your mother be brilliant , analytical , insightful , and i 'm bet she never hit you with a bible because you would n't eat your brussels sprout .
sheldon , you do n't give your mother enough credit . she 's warm , she 's love , she do n't glue electrode to your head to measure your brain wave while potty training .
you be lucky . when i be a kid , if i want an eeg , i have to attach my own electrode .
so , dr hofstadter , leonard rarely talk about his incredibly successful brother and sister .
please , do n't go there , howard .
i understand that unlike leonard , they 're at the top of their respective field .
well , leonard 's young brother , michael , be a tenure law professor at harvard , and his sister just successfully grow a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon .
why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon ?
why ? they 're not my accomplishment . i have to urinate .
why be you do this ?
you know the rule . you brought your mom to work , you must suffer .
leonard , i have no idea your sibling be so much more successful than you .
yeah , you 're like the jar jar binks of the hofstadter family .
oh , meesa think yousa lookin ' so so sad .
you know , rather than mock me , my friend might realize that this be difficult and try to help me through it .
nope , i think mock you be more fun .
next time , do n't yousa bring mama to work . okee-day ?
oh , the middle stall be occupy . i 'll have to try again later .
so , where be we ?
that 's fascinate . selective mutism be quite rare . on the other hand , an adult jewish male living with his mother be so common it border on sociological cliche .
it 's just temporary , i pay rent .
say what ? that 's basically what i just say .
leonard , it 's one o'clock , be n't you go to show me your laboratory at one o'clock ?
but it 's one o'clock , you be go to show me your laboratory at one o'clock .
her reason be unassailable . it be one o'clock .
so , no original research ?
well , what 's the point of my see it ? i could just read the paper the italian write .
just for the record , we 're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship .
well , then why do n't you say that to her ?
why be it always my responsibility ?
it 's not always your responsibility . i swear , this be the same thing you do at the comic book store last week .
i ca n't believe you 're bring that up .
i do n't bring it up . you do .
we 'll talk about this later .
you go to the comic book store without me
hey .
you get alcohol ?
yep .
come on in . wait , wait , she 's not gon na come here look for you , be she ?
oh , relax . she take sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan .
nothing . mother like look at brain and sheldon like get his brain scan .
geez , what a fun couple .
she 's only be here a day and a half and i 'm seriously consider alcoholism a a new career path .
hey , i talk to her for five minute yesterday and i 've be half bombed ever since .
you ca n't let her get into your head .
my head , what about yours ?
it 's too late for me . my head be her summer house .
she be right , you know . the locus of my identity be totally exterior to me .
oh , yeah , there she be . hi , mom .
i mean , do you know where i be all morning ? audition with _ other blonde for some stupid antidepressant commercial . and for what ? so i 'll finally get my daddy 's approval ?
do you get the part ?
no , they say i be too perky .
hey , you want to talk about not get love from a parent . you know what i use to do when i be little to have some sensation of human contact ?
yeah , you grabbed your penis and would n't let go . your mother told me .
of course she do . anyway , that 's not what i be gon na say . when i be ten year old , i built a hug machine .
a hug machine ?
yeah . i get a dressmaker 's mannequin , i stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm , and built two radio-controlled arm that would hug me and pat my back .
oh , that be so sad .
what ?
common complaint among men . nothing 's ever big enough , except when they get a tumour . then you never hear the end of it .
your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery .
understandable .
i doubt it , but if anyone have a chance , it 's probably you .
i feel very comfortable around you , too .
nor i .
be that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math ?
i 'd like that , too .
okay , now this time
uh-huh .
you 're gon na lick the salt off my neck , do the shot , and then bite the lime .
i 'm sorry , i do n't hear anything after lick .
neck , shot , lime . okay , shot , lime .
right . ah ! where 's the lime ? oh , okay , we 're share .
i 'm very tempt . i 'm just not sure it 's appropriate with my son 's roommate .
true . i 've have a similar observation . it 's certainly something i could never do with my husband .
i see what you 're do . you 're appeal to the neuroscientific researcher in me .
only when you 're in a cat scanner .
this be actually gon na happen .
why would you bring that up right now ?
i do n't know . foreplay ?
so you 're say you 're not have sex with me , you 're have sex with your mother ?
ummm , i 'm gon na go with “ no . ”
that be the sickest thing i 've ever heard .
come on , you 're try to have sex with your father , and i 'm okay with that .
get out !
she say shush . i should have shush .
that 's not really in my control , be it ? oh , uh , yes
oh , good morning .
morning .
look , i be just come over to talk to you .
you do n't have to . ever .
gotcha .
good-bye , leonard . so , slugger , shall we pick up where we left off last time ?
interest . would you be willing to fly to new jersey and discus your relationship with your parent during a brain scan ?
well , it would help me .
that be close .
god , i love the smell of paintball in the morning .
yeah , still funny , raj .
there 's no way we can get to the ridge . the chemistry department have u completely cut off .
but what about the creek bed ?
the pharmacology department control that , and they 're all hopped up on experimental steroid .
well , that 's it then , we 're doom .
i think the time have come to acknowledge that we be pay the price for some of u fail to attend my physic department paintball strategy meeting .
i told you my mom have spider vein , i have to take her to the laser clinic .
and i told you i want to see a doctor 's note .
we need a plan . how about operation hammer of the god ?
i forget . which one be hammer of the god ?
we hide behind the dumpster in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee .
no go . the dumpster be deep in astronomy department territory .
why do n't i run away and you cover me ?
because you chose your mother 's vein over victory . on three . one , two , three , go !
howard , i 'm on your team .
where 's the rest of your squad ?
do n't be . it be friendly fire . they just would n't listen .
hmm , that 's the bad part , the wait .
yeah , the big wet ball of death . kind of make you feel more alive , do n't it ?
howard , why be n't you cover u ? we 're get slaughter out here !
war be hell .
do you guy see the new budget memo that go out this morning ?
unacceptable . it baffle me why they do n't simply let some of you go so that there 's money available for my research .
hey , guy .
hey , leslie .
howard , i get the approval for the rapid prototyper you want .
you scratch my back , i scratch yours . rawr .
oh , uh , no big deal . they give leslie control of some unrestricted grant money .
yeah , okay , but what 's with the back-scratching and the meow !
i believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provide good or service to the second party in compensation for a similar action .
thank you .
the mrow , that sound to me like an african civet cat .
no . despite what the name suggests , the civet cat be not a true cat . now i 'm do .
you know what i 'm think ? i 'm think howard be n't make a back-scratching metaphor . i 'm think there be some actual scratch involve .
what about it , howard ?
okay , i do n't want to say anything 'cause i know you and leslie have a little history .
i do n't care about that .
great , 'cause i 've be die to say something .
you and leslie ?
in the paintball shed ! twice !
be that why you do n't cover our escape and let u get cut down like animal ?
oh , yeah , sorry about that .
my good man , dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy be a court-martial offense .
court-martial , schmort-martial , leslie winkle be the fifth girl i 've ever have sex with . i mean , for free .
and plus , you get a rapid prototyper . that 's an expensive piece of equipment , dude .

that 's all ?
before tax .
well , i do n't have to pay tax on this stuff .
i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree . but , if you take advantage of modern marketing technique , and you optimize your manufacturing process , you might be able to make this a viable business .
penny , i 'm a physicist . i have a work knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains .
who 's radiohead ?
i have a work knowledge of the important thing in the universe . good luck .
sheldon , hold on . could you maybe show me how to make more money with this ?

sheldon , wait ! will you ?
and you understand that will involve me tell you what to do ?
i understand .
and you 're not allow to be sarcastic or snide to me while i 'm do so .

penny 's make hair accessory . i 'm help her optimize her manufacturing process . all right , break 's over .
hold on . what be you use a a bonding agent ?
hot glue .
it wo n't work , the flower 's too porous .
what if we infuse the bottom layer with silicone-rtv to provide a well mount surface ?
intrigue .
good question , what be you marketing and distribution channel ?
well , there be the waitress at my work , and this cute , little shop in old town .
hush , hush , hush , hush , hush , virtually non-existent . i 'm think that we set her up with a host turnkey e-commerce system to start .
why not eliminate the middle man ? we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom .
she 'd need some kind of industrial cool system .
of course , but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure , we should finish optimize the manufacturing process . to start with , she have a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump .
yeah , it 's a bitch .
uh , i 've see this before .
where ?
it 's a common stripper problem . they dance , they sweat , they clump .
ew .
be you think about add a desiccant like calcium sulphate ?

let 's think out of the box for a moment . how about a molecular sieve ?
oh !
i 've get a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen .
wow .

what i want be irrelevant . this be penny 's decision . penny ?

okay , well , i 'm gon na have to call them and cancel the order .
excuse me , but be this not your goal ? financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation ? my brilliance and innovation , of course , but still .
i just do n't see how see can pull this off .
okay , that , right there , that equivocation and self-doubt , that be not the american spirit . do davy crockett quit at the alamo ? do jim bowie ?

notify the editor of the oxford english dictionary , the word plenty have be redefine to mean two .
uh , what about that girl last year at comic-con ?
why not ?
what happens in costume at comic-con , stay at comic-con .

h-h-h-how do we get on me , we be mock leonard for not move on . dude , you have totally not move on .
yes i have , it 's just a matter of actually make a date with someone .
like who ?
well , there 's joyce kim , but she defect back to north korea so it 's a little geographically undesireable .
what about leslie winkle .
oh no .
why ?
her research methodology be sloppy , she 's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity , and to make matter bad she 's often mean to me .
i think she 's smoking hot
i 'd hit that .
you 'd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension . mud .
look , i like leslie , but she 's not interested in date a much a use men a tool for stress release .
yeah , so , be a tool . go get yourself a little rebound stress release .
technically it would only be rebound if he and penny have actually engage in physical intimacy .
you mean like you and richard the slave girl ?
i bought him dinner and we kiss once , that be it . and he told me his name be kimberley !
you know how i know we 're not in the matrix ?
how ?
hey , leonard .
hey , dummy .
ooh , rush me to the burn unit . hey , leonard , do you have a second , i need to ask you something .
uh , sure .
wow . so , i heard your relationship with penny crashed to the ground like blue ice fall out of an airplane lavatory .
actually i read it . wolowitz texted me .
i thought it be a pretty good one , i give him an l-o-l . anyway , it get me think , now that you 're unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment .
no , i 'm all do with casual sex . from now on i 'm fully commit to the traditional relationship paradigm .
it 's hard to say , i guess there 's just a time in every woman 's life when she get tire of wake up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she do n't know .
anyway , i just figure it 's time to slow thing down and who well to slow thing down with than you ?
your place , we 'll order chinese , you 'll rent a movie , artsy but accessible , then light pet , no coitus .
great . call me .
great news . my mom sent me my old nintendo _ .

well , the thing be , someone 's come over .
sheldon , it 's a date , i have a date come over .
oh , well you ca n't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion .
why , what 's so unusual about me have a date ?
well , statistically speak
alright , alright . well , uh , nevertheless , i have one now and i would appreciate it if you would , you know , make yourself scarce .
leonard , i be a publish theoretical physicist with two doctorate and an iq which ca n't be accurately measure by normal test , how much scarcer could i be ?
you know what i mean , could you just give u a little privacy ?
you want me to leave the apartment ?
yes .
yes .
well , why should i leave , this be my apartment too .
i know it be , and if science ever discovers a second member of your specie and you two would like some privacy i would be more than happy to get out of your way .
well alright then .
sheldon ? what be you do ?
yeah , but why be you do it on the stair ?
i 'm a modern day napoleon exile to the elba of the staircase because leonard , get this , have a date .
oh . oh , well , good for him . yeah but , why be you sit here , why do n't you just go to a movie or something ?
alone ?

i have to make pee-pee .
if by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive east texas blowhole , i agree .
me too . you 're sure you 're okay postpone intercourse until our relationship be past the initial viability test ?
yes . i believe protocol dictate that you wait a minimum of _ hour before you call so i 'm not repulse by your cloy eagerness .
again , it 's your decision , you 're the man .
no , he be some kind of scientist , let me start again . oh , hey leonard .

i 'm sorry , i be not go back to the renaissance fair .
i do n't care . there be far too many historical anomaly for my comfort .
oh , okay , how about this . you can go dress a a star trek science officer explore a planet similar to earth in the 1500s .
you mean like spock ?
sure .
hey fellow scientist . sheldon .
hey , why do n't we all move over there so leslie can join u .
hmm , let 's do it .
if you 're have trouble decide where to sit may i suggest one potato two potato , or a i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology .
do n't make this hard for me .
it 's not hard . it 's simple . you can either sit with me , your friend , colleague and roommate , or you can sit with an overrate scientist you might have sex with .
you 're right , it be simple .
penny .
third floor tonight . mix it up ? oh . you know , i still do n't understand why you just do n't go to dinner or something .
alright , let 's say i go to dinner alone . and during the meal i have to use the rest room . how do i know someone 's not touch my food ?
goodnight sheldon .
penny , hold on . be you sure thing ca n't work out with you and leonard ?
excuse me ?
i 'm just wonder if you really give it the old college try ? or in your case the old community college try ?
okay , where be this come from ?
leonard be upstairs right now with my arch enemy .
your arch enemy ?
yes , the doctor doom to my mr fantastic . the doctor octopus to my spiderman . the doctor sivana to my captain marvel .
okay , i get it , i get it , i get it .
do you know , it 's amaze how many supervillains have advanced degree . graduate school should probably do a well job of screen those people out .
sheldon , come back , you 're lose me .
leslie winkle , penny . she belittles my research .
oh , sweetie , i 'm sorry .
she call me dumbass .
i know . i heard .
give this situation , i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objection to your ill consider relationship with leonard .
oh , gee , well , thankyou for that . but , um , i think for now leonard and i be just go to stay friend .
no , that response be unacceptable to me .
sheldon , you be a smart guy , you must know
smart ? i 'd have to lose _ iq point to be classify a smart .
be you go to let me talk ?
i 'm sorry .
you must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together , nothing you can do be go to stop it .
okay , let me put it this way , if you 're really leonard 's friend you will support him no matter who he want to be with .
because love trump hate .
oh now you 're just make stuff up .
okay . goodnight sheldon .
oh mario . if only i could control everyone the way i control you . hop , you little plumber , hop , hop , hop .
when the two of you reach a natural stop point i 'd like to have a word .
if the word be pee-pee , just do it .
leonard , you be my friend . and friend support their friend , apparently . so i be withdraw my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie .
thank you .
hang on a second . loop quantum gravity clearly offer more testable prediction than string theory .
okay , well , for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself a minute difference in the speed of light for different colour .
be you go to let him talk to me like that ?
no there be n't , only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black hole .
sheldon , do n't make that noise , it 's disrespectful .
you agree with me , right , loop quantum gravity be the future of physic .
well , i 'm glad i found out the truth about you before this go any far .
oh , it be n't , really ? tell me leonard , how would we raise the child ?
i 'm sorry , i could have accepted our kid be genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade , but this ? this be a deal breaker .

penny , just because people appreciate comic book do n't make them weirdo . stuart 's a terrific artist . he go to the rhode island school of design .
what about the guy over there in the superhero t-shirt tucked into his sweatpants ?
ah , yeah , that 's captain sweatpants . he do n't really help the point i 'm try to make .

you drive a hard bargain , but here .
all right . so , um , just give me a call .
apparently so .
be you ill ?
no .
all right . then be it fair to say that you 're experience some sort of emotional turmoil over the event involve penny earlier this even ?
when do you pick up on that ?
a moment ago , when you turn off the tv in the middle of during the classic deep space nine/star trek the original series trouble with tribbles crossover episode . would you like some advice ?
sure , why not ?
then , this be the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comment section .
gee , thanks a lot .
would you rather i offer my personal insight ?
i do n't need any insight . i just want to know why penny 's more interested in stuart than me . we 're practically the same guy .
oh , i disagree . stuart be taller , artistic , self-employed and , most significantly , he get _ percent off comic book .
you 're right , i really should be ask stranger on the internet .
my original point .

gotcha . i 'll have a brandy alexander .
all right , the three musketeer just become the dynamic duo .
should we talk to some of these woman ?
it 's way too early in the night for that . see , first we let the lawyer and the jock thin the herd , and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame .

be this conversation make you uncomfortable ?
i really have no idea . i do n't particularly excel at reading facial expression , body language

a little baby .
boy , would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket ?
esther rosenblatt .
be you suggest i sleep on the couch .
well , it be n't the first suggestion that come to mind , but it 's the one i 'm go with .
i ca n't sleep on your couch . i sleep in a bed . and give it 's dimension i have no intention of living out e.m snicker 's beloved child 's book , the tall man from cornwall .
there be a tall man from cornwall whose length exceed his bed . my body fit on it , but barely upon it , there 's no room for my big cornish head .
oh , alright . i will give you my bed on one condition . that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hour .

cut the crap , you set this up , do n't you ?
yes .
she 's a hooker , be n't she .
a prostitute , yes .
yes .
thank you !
penny .
what ?
i ca n't sleep . how be you go ?
maybe that 's because your hole be still open .
i 'm homesick .
your home be twenty foot from here .
twenty foot , twenty light year , it do n't matter . it 's in a galaxy far , far away .
damn it . what do you want me to do
sing soft kitty .
that 's only for when you 're sick .
homesick be a type of be sick .
come on , do i really have to ?
i suppose we can stay up and talk .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur . happy kitty , um
sleepy kitty .
sleepy ki
no . start over .
thank you for let me stay here .
oh , you 're welcome sweetie .
okay , i 'm sleepy now , get out .
oh , good , you 're finally home .
what be you do at penny 's ?
well , we have dinner , uh , played some game , and then i spent the night . oh , you 'll be happy to know that i now have a much well understand of friend with benefit .
smell that ? that 's the smell of new comic book . oh , yes !
they 're on me today , boy .
you 're pay ? have you be sell your sperm again ?
no , i 'm celebrate . a we speak , the space shuttle be dock at the international space station where it will deploy the wolowitz zero-gravity waste disposal system .
oh , get over yourself , it 's a high-tech toilet .
just think . thanks to your hard work , an international crew of astronaut will boldly go where no man have go before .
be that suppose to be funny ?
i believe it be . the combination of the star trek reference and the play on word involve the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that leonard be humorously mock your effort in space plumbing .
okay , make your little joke , but of the four of u , i 'm the only one make any real-world contribution to science and technology .
he 's right . this be an important achievement , for two reason . number one , and , of course , number two .
here , sheldon , i pull the new hellboy for you . it 's mind-blowing .
i do n't spoil anything .
i 'm sorry .
uh , hey , leonard , can i talk to you about something ?
remember i go out with your friend penny a couple week ago ?
yeah , vaguely .
sure you remember . you go to the bar and make a fool of yourself try to pick up strange woman .
well , uh , the thing be , the date do n't go that well .
‘ cause we 're go out again tomorrow .
no .
uh , anyway , i figure this be probably my last shot with penny and i do n't want to screw it up .
so , here 's my question . it 's the second date , you think she 'll be expect thing to get physical ?
okay , so , you 'll give me a call ?
great .
or nobody call anyone .
interest . penny 's current suitor ask advice from her former suitor .
you know , thanks for closed-captioning my pain , raj .
hey , wan na make sure he get nowhere with penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them ?
i 'm listen .
just tell him to do everything you 've do with her for the last two year .
hey , leonard .
oh , hi .
how 's it go ?
good , good . you ?
fine . oh , hey , can i ask you something ?
sure .
you know your friend stuart ?
yes .
well , he ask me out again and i say yes , and then i start think maybe i should talk to you first .
about what ?
yeah , well i would n't say cool , i 'd just say , that 's leonard !
well , in that case , do you mind give me some advice ?
about stuart ? love to .
he 's very shy , how do i make him feel more comfortable around me ?
well , uh , first of all , do n't underestimate the value of discomfort .
really ?
well , yeah , stuart thrives under pressure , that 's why he work in a comic book store .
oh . it 's stuart .
you 're not go to answer it ?
he want to talk about penny . i do n't want to talk about penny .
you 're make an assumption . perhaps the comic book store be on fire , and he need your assistance .
why would he call me ?
we do n't know . and if you do n't answer the phone , we ca n't know .
i 'm not answer the phone , sheldon .
answer the phone , leonard .
no ! there , it go to voice mail .
be n't you go to check your message ?
it must be hell inside your head .
at time .
guy , we have a code red .
do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert , code red the computer worm , or code red the cherry flavour soft drink from the maker of mountain dew ?
look , i be go over the schematic on my zero-g toilet , and i make a teeny tiny mistake on the specification for the diverter valve .
how teeny tiny ?
it 's gon na fail after about ten flush .
have you notify nasa ?
well , what be you gon na do ?
i 'm gon na figure out how to fix it , then i 'll tell them .
so , what do you need u for ?
hey , you say you be gon na be supportive .
i 'm try , but you have to admit this be pretty damn funny .
i agree . it 's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunction toilet that provide the comic fodder here . check your message .
good one .
you mean so it do n't hit the fan ?
hey leonard .
you busy ?
um
well , tonight 's my date with penny and since we have n't be able to connect by phone
or e-mail .
anyway , i be just wonder if you have any last-minute advice .
fear ?
well , that play right into my wheelhouse .
thanks , leonard . what be that thing anyway ?
no .
good . get out .
it be n't bad advice . it just be n't particularly helpful .
for what it 's worth , my mother say that when we deceive for personal gain , we make jesus cry .
i feel terrible .
maybe if you be help , you 'd feel well about yourself .
i deliberately try to sabotage stuart 's date with penny .
of course you feel terrible . you completely screw up your karma , dude .
speak of what go around come around
okay , look . instead of try to reinforce this structure here , what if we just ran another line , bypass it entirely ?
it wo n't work . the diameter of the tube be insufficient .
what if we reposition the collection tank ?
it wo n't work . no way to mount it .
okay , here 's an idea . what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband avi in israel ?
that could work .
morning .
morning . what 's up ?
nothing . we just pull an all-nighter try to fix a zero-gravity pasta maker . i 'm gon na make a coffee run . do you want any ?
great . so how 'd it go with stuart last night ?
i really do n't want to talk about it .
yeah . right . sure . the thing be , before you guy go out , i spoke to him and
i say i do n't want to talk about it .
okay i just i kind of
look , leonard , what go on between me and stuart be none of your business . so just leave it alone , okay ?
hang on , i think i 've get this . help me see if we can wedge this little piece of pvc behind the support rod .
if you knew what you be do , there would n't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be .
howard , wait . why do n't you use this instead of the pvc to keep the transverse filter assembly in place ?
where be you go ?
comic book store .
oh , an excellent idea ! i could certainly use a break .
me , too .
hold on , you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space .
why do leonard get to go ?
‘ cause he 's upset over his situation with penny and if i have to hear about it again , i 'm go to kick him in his ovary .
thanks for understand , howard .
i get your back , sister . all right , i think we 've get a prototype ready to test . hand me that tupperware .
damn right it 's heavy , it 's my mother 's meat loaf , it 's be test toilet for generation .
okay , simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three , two , one .
fascinate .
what do you think the problem be ?
not enough bread crumb .
sure , what 's up ?
no , your advice be great .
yeah , go slow really work .
yeah , last night at dinner , i do what you told me , i go really slow , i kept my distance , and two bottle of wine later , we be make out in my car .
it do n't matter , that 's where it all go to hell .
no , everything be good and really hot , and i say “ oh , penny , ” and right where she be suppose to say , “ oh , stuart , ” she say your name .
well , it beat you know i 'm a dude , right ? yeah , it be pretty bad .
not your fault .
yes , sir , i understand classify . we 'll keep it all classify , no one have to know but you and me .
what 's classify ?
howard 's space toilet . i 'll tell you later .
well , they 've deployed our solution . let 's just all hope it work .
i do n't see why i have to worry . my career 's not hang in the balance . that be a joke . it 's funny , because it 's true .
leonard , could you pas the soy sauce , please ?
i 'm sorry , be you talk to me ?
yeah , i say leonard .
yes , you do , do n't you ?
what the hell be that ?
meatloaf .
what be it do on the ceiling ?
uh , houston , this be more of an fyi call . we be basically out the door .
oh , boy .
what ?
i ca n't comment without violate our agreement that i do n't criticize your work .
then what be oh , boy ?
great restraint on my part .
there 's nothing wrong with the science here .
perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science .
why ?
it do n't say . it must be an emergency . everyone at the university know i eat breakfast at eight and move my bowel at _ .
yeah , i know the feel .
leonard . leonard . leonard .
sheldon , it 's two o'clock in the morning .
why be everybody keep tell me what time it be ?
everybody ?
you , the president of the university , his wife , their sullen teenage daughter . that entire family be fascinate by what time it be and whether people know it .
you go to president seibert 's house in the middle of the night ?
he do n't respond to my e-mail , his phone number be unlisted . tell me what my other option be .
you could have wait until morning . i know , look who i 'm talk to .
do you remember the grant proposal i submit to the national science foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic north pole ?
hardly a day go by when i do n't think about it .
wait a minute . he offer to send you to the north pole ?
yes . in fact , he be quite enthusiastic . he say , “ frankly , if i could send you tonight , i would . ”
sure , maybe a tableau of me try to pummel you to death .
sarcasm ?
maybe .
i 'm on the horn of a dilemma . can you imagine me , sheldon cooper , at the north pole ?
i 'm not good with cold , leonard . how often have we have to leave a movie theatre because i get a headache from drinking the icee too fast ? i ca n't go .
well , then do n't go .
how can you say that ? the scientific opportunity of a lifetime present itself and my best friend say do n't go .
all right , then go .
listen to you . how can i possibly go ?
sheldon , what be the word i can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep ?
odd , president seibert pose the exact same question .
how be it resolve ?
it be n't . his wife set their dog on me and render the question moot .
just imagine . if he say yes , we 'll have an entire summer without sheldon .
we could play outside .
we could sit on the left side of the couch .
i could use the bathroom at _ .
yeah ! woo-hoo !
…the invitation to join the arctic expedition .
it 's not gon na be the same without you .
godspeed .
ooh , i do n't like where this be go .
i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me .
to the north pole ?
yes .
be this just so we wo n't touch your stuff while you 're away ?
i 'll admit that be a concern . but the fact be , i 'll need a support team . and the three of you be my first choice .
we 're not really gon na go to the north pole with him , be we ?
i 'm still within earshot ! you may want to wait for my door to close .
we 're not really gon na go to the north pole with him , be we ?
but if we be part of the team that confirm string theory , we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that have a strong science program .
howard , this be big science . you could be the engineer who build the equipment that put u on the cover of magazine .
i could also be the engineer who build the crossbow that kill sheldon .
you still might get on a magazine .
so you guy be seriously consider this ?
well , gentleman , have you reach a decision ?
i 'm in .
me , too .
oh , damn it . peer pressure . fine .
excellent . and just an fyi , a i be the expedition 's team leader , protocol dictate that be phrase fine , sir . but do n't worry , there will be a briefing .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
penny .
sheldon .
penny .
what do you want ?
i need access to the cheesecake factory 's walk-in freezer .
now , honey , i already told you , the hamburger meat be fresh and store at a safe temperature .
no . this be to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic north pole .
what ?
you 're all go ?
yes .
for three month ?
yes .
hey , leonard .
hi .
sheldon say you 're go to the north pole .
yeah . pretty cool , huh ?
oh , hey , no , you do n't have to apologize . there 's no reason you have to tell me . i be just , you know , surprised .
yes , yes , you be busy , you be surprised , all very fascinate . now where do we stand on the freezer ?
actually , it would help .
all right , i 'll see what i can do . so , three month at the north pole . wow , that be awesome .
yeah .
i 'm sorry , but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action ?
just a warn , sheldon , the freezer lock from the outside .
do she seem upset to you ?
no . do she seem upset to you ?
no .
oh , good , i get it right . be you upset ?
a little bit .
two for two . i 'm on fire .
i mean , i know she 's not my girlfriend or anything , but would n't you think she 'd feel a little bad that i 'm go to be go for the whole summer ?
alright , now the purpose of this drill be to acclimate u to the use of tool in extreme temperature such a we will face in the arctic circle .
for this i go to mit .
and begin .
i think i swallow some paint !
i ca n't press any of the button with my glove . oh , son of a bitch !
adversity be to be expect . continue .
oh , boy , be i gon na get sue .
okay , i ca n't do this .
you heard the man . hold him down and i 'll cut him open .
hang on , i know i do n't posse the tool of leadership , but i do n't understand why we ca n't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside .
i have n't thought of that . i guess we 're do here .
here , drink slash eat this .
what be it ?
it 's hot chocolate with a stick of butter .
okay , why ?
because in the frigid temperature in the arctic , we need to consume at least _ calorie a day just to maintain our body weight .
sheldon , you know i ca n't eat butter . i 'm lactose intolerant .
way ahead of you , that 's an “ i ca n't believe it 's not butter ” stick .
i do n't care what the other guy be do . if the other guy jumped in the bay of bengal and try to swim to sri lanka , would you follow them ?
do n't talk back to your mother . this trip be much too dangerous , rajesh .
so , she have no problem with her son be eat by a walrus ?
that 's very unlikely , mr koothrappali . if raj dy , it 'll be from frostbite , gangrene , acute sunburn or be ripped to shred by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear .
ma , i 'm put you on speakerphone with raj 's parent . can you tell them that you 're okay with me go to the arctic ?
arctic ? i thought you say arkansas !
i do n't say that . you never listen to me !
he do n't tell me anything ! he life a secret life because he 's ashamed !
hey , leonard , can i talk to you for a sec ?
sure , but let 's go out here where there 's a little less yell and guilt . what 's up ?
well , i get you a little go away present .
oh , a blanket .
oh , no , no , no , not just a blanket . see , it have sleeve . yeah ! so , you can , you know , be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff .
oh , wow , cool .
oh , i 'm gon na miss you . see you later .
‘ cause it do n't make sense to me ! how can it be that in the entire country of india , there be n't one outback steakhouse ? !
sheldon , sheldon ?
i want a cookie , meemaw .
but meemaw just make cooky .
listen , i do n't know if i can go on the expedition .
what ?
okay , leonard , i know you 're concerned about disappoint me but i want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectation of you be very low .
yeah , that 's very comfort .
comfort be a part of leadership . it 's not a part i care for , but such be my burden .
terrific , it 's just that i do n't think penny want me to go .
assume that 's a valid reason not to go , which it be n't , how do you know this ? do she say it ?
not exactly . but she say she be gon na miss me and she give me this .
what be it ?
it 's a blanket with sleeve .
oh , that 's clever . let me see if i understand this correctly . her miss you be an emotional state you find desirable ?
yes , obviously .
all right . well , give that miss you be predicate on you leave , logic dictate you must leave .
yes , okay , but i 'm gon na be go for three month . what if she do n't miss me that long and she meet someone else ?
she do have a short attention span .
so , i ca n't go .
leonard , you may be right . it appear that penny secretly want you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion .
you really think so ?
of course not . even in my sleep-deprived state , i 've manage to pull off another one of my classic prank . bazinga !
oh , leonard , what time be it ?
it 's _ a.m . i 'm sorry it 's early , but we 're leave soon , and i need to talk to you .
okay .
what do you mean when you say you 're go to miss me ?
um , i do n't know . you 'll be go and i 'll notice .
okay , well , um , what about this ? what do this mean ?
wine , credit card and late night television be a bad combination .
all right , fine . what about that really long hug ? what do that mean ?
it be at least five mississippi . a standard hug be two mississippi top .
leonard , i do n't know what to tell you . it be just a hug .
yeah .
i guess i 'll see you .
okay , have a safe trip .
thank you . bye .
okay , bye . mean i wish you be n't go .
what ?
he 's right .
it be remarkable .
so , who 's up for a movie ?
good idea , what do you think ? ice station zebra or john carpenter 's the thing ?
dinner 's ready !
what be we have ?
do you bring the dehydrate low-sodium soy sauce ?
check .
check .
flash-frozen brown rice , not white ?
uh , oh , sorry .
not to worry . i hid it . bazinga ! you 're in my spot .
there 's no time for a crossbow . find me an icicle .
yes , i ca n't get my stupid door open .
you appear to have put your car key in the door lock , be you aware of that ?
yeah !
alright then .
dammit , dammit , dammit , dammit , dammit , dammit .
would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly ?
i ca n't get the damn key out .
well that 's not surprising . that baldwin lock on your door us traditional edge mount cylinder , whereas the key for your volkswagon us a centre cylinder system .
thankyou , sheldon .
well , actually , insect be a dietary staple in many culture , they 're almost pure protein .
oh , sonofabitch !
i believe the condensation on your frozen food weaken the structural integrity of the bag . but return to your key conundrum , perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you .
i do , and he say he 'll get here when he get here .
and you 're frustrate because he phrase his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology ?
no ! i be frustrate because i be a failure at everything and my breath smell like fly .
there there . would you prefer to wait in our apartment ?
no sheldon , i 'd rather sit on this freeze cold floor sob like a three year-old .
for god 's sake !
just when i think i 've gotten the hang of sarcasm .
make yourself comfortable . not there . sheldor be back online .
sheldor ?
what be you do ?
oh .
what 's afk ?
afk . away from keyboard .
oic .
what do that stand for ?
oh , i see ?
yes , but what do it stand for ?
now just click on the enchant boot to put them on .
oh , i do n't know . can i see them in another colour ?
just click on them . congratulation , you be now a level three warrior .
what 's go on ?
leonard , guess what , i 'm a level three warrior .
great , you know there be grocery outside of your apartment ?
yeah yeah yeah , shhh !

okay , we 're all set .
let her rip .
hey , check it out , it 's just corn starch and water .
they make up a non-newtonian fluid which be liquid , but solid under the percussive action of the speaker .
that 's what make it get all funky .
no , that 's what she say , sheldon .
okay , look , i bought the game , and i 've be explore the island of tordage but i ca n't figure out how to get past the guard captain .

there you go , one enchant sword .
that girl need to get a life .

a griffin ?
yes , half eagle , half lion .
my point be , if koothrappali be move on to a new life of shallow , undeserved fame , perhaps this be an opportunity to create a well cohort .
sheldon , do n't take this the wrong way , but , you 're insane .
that may well be , but the fact be , it would n't kill u to meet some new people .

if we do get a new friend , he should be a guy you can trust . a guy who have your back .
and he should have a lot of money , and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw party .

oh yes , like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rut baboon with engorge hindquarter .
or in this case , the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye .
mock me if you will , but it work . you show up at a club in something distinctive , scope out your target and toss out some negs .
you 're not gon na need wingman , you 're gon na need a paramedic .

ow .
i 'm sorry , but i 'm not go to watch the clone war tv series until i 've see the clone war movie . i prefer to let george lucas disappoint me in the order he intend .
well , i want to watch it now .
then i believe we 've arrive at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors lizard-spock moment .
watch whatever you want .
i saw what you do there .
what do i do ?
hello . hey , howard . what 's wrong ? okay . okay , we 'll be right there .
what happen ?
howard 's at the mar rover lab . he say he 's in trouble . defcon _ .

defcon _ mean no danger . defcon _ be a crisis .
how can _ not be bad than _ ?
yeah , star trek v , bad than i .
okay , first of all , that 's a comparison of quality , not intensity . secondly , star trek i be orders-of-magnitude bad than star trek v .
be you joking ? star trek v be the standard against which all badness be measure .
no , no , no . star trek v have specific failure in write and direction , while star trek i fails across the board , art direction , costume , music , sound edit .
can we just forget i say defcon and go ?
star trek v !
all right , will you at least stipulate that star trek iv : the voyage home be inarguably the best ?
i have three word for you . wrath of khan .
what 's the emergency ?
i get the mar rover stuck in a ditch .
where ?
yeah , baby , i 'll be right in .
you brought a girl to the mar rover control room ?

you 're not gon na see me now .
ooh . cool .
anything ?
actually , i be just check my e-mail . but , uh , no , the rover be not respond .
i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any mean of propulsion .
hang on , there 's get to be other option .
you could try call triple-a , but base on nasa 's late timetable , they wo n't get there for _ year .
plus i understand you have to be stand next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive .
oh , snap .
snap what ?
ok , i guess we have to turn to plan b .
thank god for plan b .
howard , do n't you say you work on the mar rover ?

so you brought me in here to inform me that you ca n't tell me where you 're go and you ca n't tell me who might ask ?

i do n't make the rule , leonard .
howard , come on , i do n't plan on this . these thing just happen . usually not to me , but they do happen .
do someone just feel a cold breeze ?
i believe this be an extension of the death metaphor . the cold breeze be the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembody soul passing by .
you know , screw it , i 'm just gon na eat the dumpling .
be this a bad time ?
yeah , but i do n't see a well one on the horizon , so
hello , howard .
sheldon ?
look i 'm sorry , you violate the term of your metaphor by acknowledge her existence . i 'm out .
okay , i guess it 'll just be the three of u then .

son of a bitch .
hey , sheldon .
what be shake ?
i 'm sorry ?
it 's colloquial , a conversation opener . so , do you find the weather satisfy ? be you currently share in the triumph of some local sport team ?
i 'm strike up a casual conversation with you . s ' u'up ?
please do n't do that .
all right , but i 'm give to understand that when you have something awkward to discus with someone , it 's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat .
so , this be n't the awkward part ?
no .
oh , all right . s ' u'up ?
oh , good , i use that right . anyway , you 're aware that leonard have enter into a new romantic relationship which include a sexual component ?
okay , feel the awkward now .
her name be dr stephanie barnett and she be a highly distinguish surgical resident at freemont memorial .
yeah , leonard told me .
good . what he may have left out be how important this relationship be to me .
to you ?
yes , see , of the handful of woman leonard 's be involve with , she 's the only one i have ever found tolerable .
the statement stand for itself .
well , be n't you sweet ?
anyway , should you have any interaction with her , it would be most helpful that she not see you a a sexual rival .
yes . now , should that happen , i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido .
i could think about you .
fine , whatever work .
always nice talk to you , sheldon .
uh , peace out !
well , this be very pleasant .
i 'm glad you 're enjoy yourself .
and you say there 'd never be enough pasta for the three of u .
i stand correct .
thank you .
no .
ih-uh , strawberry .
uh , lawrence memorial in galveston , texas .
you 're kid !
why , what-what-what happen ?
do you understand that this be suppose to be a date ?
i do . do you ? because frankly , you 've be in a foul mood since i sat down .
okay , here 's my question , why do you sit down ?
to help . look , if you fail at this relationship , and history suggests you will , then we risk lose the medical officer that our land party have always need .
what land party ?
so , we 're all stand around look at the post-op x ray and there it be , clear a day , right in the guy 's chest cavity , one of my earring .
what do you think i do ? i discreetly slip off the other earring , put it in my pocket and then get the hell out of there !
i have a bone to pick with you , sir .
hi , sheldon .
hi , stephanie . i 'm sorry i 'm late , but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation .
what invitation ?
we 're go to the movie . what movie ? what theatre ? what time ? if you be try to make it impossible to locate you , you could n't have do a well job .
oh , clearly i could have .
no , no , we have seat .
no , it 's fine . you know , he 's sweet .
my apology , you 've be sit in it all along . leonard , you want to slide over one ?
no , just sit here .
oh , yeah , this be it .
leonard leonard leonard .
what , sheldon ? what , sheldon ? what , sheldon ?
tell me what you see here .
the blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial ?
this be stephanie 's facebook page . now , where it should say in a relationship , what do it say ?
stephanie barnett be single .
yeah , furthermore , earlier this even , she threw a digital sheep at some guy name mike . who 's mike ? why do he get a digital sheep and not you ?
it 's just her facebook page and we 've only be go out a couple of week .
you do n't see it , do you ? we 're lose her .
i 'm afraid i ca n't allow that . pursuant to starfleet general order _ section a , you be deem unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command .
give me one good reason why not .
because this be not star trek
penny penny penny .
what ?
this be banana bread .
this be a door knob .
it 's my understand that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat .
sheldon , would you like to come in ?
i suppose i could spare a few minute . be you robbed ?
no .
how can you be sure ?
sheldon , what do you want ?
i 'm certain this will come a no surprise to you , but leonard be fail in yet another relationship .
we never get to the bedroom .
it 's not enough that you make me watch that movie , but now you mock me with it ?
gentleman , i have a question about date and relationship .
you told me you be go to have the talk with him .
i 've be wait for someone to have the talk with me .
more to the point , it 's about find a way to keep leonard and stephanie together .
oh , i do n't think you can .
well , why not ?
look at leonard 's record . _ day with joyce kim .
during which she defect to north korea .
two booty call with leslie winkle .
for which she award him the nickname “ speed of light leonard . ”
and a three hour dinner with penny .
which would have be two and a half if they order the souffle when they sat down .
base on the geometric progression , his relationship with stephanie should have end after _ minute .
yes , i 'm aware of the math , y equal _ day over _ to the nth , the issue remains , how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection ?
so , that 's all you 've get ? apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne ?
yes .
yeah .
penny penny .
what ?
penny . zucchini bread .
oh , thank you .
may i come in ?
no .

leonard , you 're back .
yeah , i just stop by to say yeah , so , hi !
dammit , i should have go over and told her we be back .
yeah , it be first come , first serve .
i just want you both to know , when i publish my finding , i wo n't forget your contribution .
great .
thanks .
of course , i ca n't mention you in my nobel acceptance speech , but when i get round to write my memoir you can expect a very effusive footnote , and perhaps a sign copy .
we have to tell him .
tell me what ?
damn his vulcan hearing .
you fellow be planning a party for me , be n't you ?
okay , sheldon , sit down .
if there 's go to be a theme , i should let you know that i do n't care for luau , toga or under the sea .
yeah , we 'll keep that in mind , look , we need to talk to you about something that happen at the north pole .
it 's not about that .
and we agree to never speak of it again .
so we slept together naked . it be only to keep our core body temperature from plummet .
for me , it be a bonding moment .
sheldon , you remember the first few week we be look for magnetic monopoles and not find anything and you be act like an obnoxious , giant dictator ?
i thought we be go to be gentle with him .
that 's why i add the tator . and then when we found our first positive data , you be so happy .
oh , yes . in the world of emoticon , i be colon , capital d .
well , in actuality , what your equipment detect be n't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles a it be static from the electric can opener we be turn on and off .
he just go colon , capital o .
you tamper with my experiment ?
we have to .
it be the only way to keep you from be such a huge dickensian . you see that ? i add the ensian .
do leonard know about this ? leonard 's my best friend in the world . surely leonard do n't know .
actually , it be his idea .
of course it be . the whole plan reek of leonard .
i miss you so much .
i miss you , too .
me , neither . except for one night when the heat go out . long story , it's do n't ask .
leonard . leonard . leonard .
do not make a sound .
whisper do not make a sound be a sound .
damn his vulcan hearing . not a good time , sheldon .
penny . penny . penny .
oh , this be ridiculous . what ?
hello , penny . i realize you 're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urge , but a you have an entire lifetime of poor decision ahead of you , may i interrupt this one ?
it 's great to see you too . come on in .
be that true ?
it be the only way to make him happy .
that seem like a bit of an overreaction .
no , the overreaction be the plan to tie your limb to four different sled dog team and yell mush . look , we kept the original data . you can still publish the actual result .
yes , but the actual result be unsuccessful and i 've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explain that i have confirm string theory and forever change man 's understand of the universe .
oh , the poor thing .
yeah , i feel terrible .
wait , wait . be n't you go to go talk to him ?
no , you 're right , you should n't talk to him . i will .

i call it the mario and luigi , but whatever . hey , how 's sheldon do ?

if i may abruptly change the subject , do you and penny finally you know .
howard
well , tell your genitals what i do with penny be none of their business .
he say they do n't do it .
sheldon , over here .
what be you do ?
i feel bad for the guy .

red alert , leonard . sheldon ran away .
man , i can not catch a break .
so , how do you know he ran away ?
well , he 's not answer his phone , he hand in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that say , i 'm run away .

and that be your opinion .
do n't tell me prayer do n't work .
how about that ? i finally caught a break .
you know how they say when friend have sex it can get weird ?
sure .
why do it have to get weird ?
i do n't know .
i mean , we be friend , and now we 're more than friend . we 're whatever this be . but why label it , right ? i mean , it be what it be and
leonard ?
yeah ?
totally .
hey , leonard , check this out .
i think it upset sheldon when you play with the food .
no . it upset sheldon when she willy-nilly take it from the container without regard for it equitable distribution . this be essentially why you have famine in india .
you want me to put it back ?
leonard .
it upset sheldon when you play with the sheldon .
what 's up , my nerdizzles ? raj , sheldon , i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette .
leonard , penny , you know my girlfriend bernadette .
yeah . hey .
i hope it 's all right , i told my girlfriend bernadette she could join u for dinner .
sure . the more , the merrier .
wait , no , that 's a false equivalency . more do not equal merry . if there be _ people in this apartment right now , would we be celebrate ? no , we 'd be suffocate .
sheldon
do n't sheldon me . we order for five people , not six .
oh , come on , it 's fine . we 'll just put it all on the table , you know , family style .
oh , sure . and while we 're at it , why do n't we put our hand behind our back , have an old-fashioned eat contest ?
what ?
why not ?
ooh , i love your shoe .
where 'd you get them ?
i 've be meaning to go over there .
oh , great selection , great price .
my mother be right . hell be real .
come on , sheldon . let the womenfolk chat .
womenfolk ?
gal ? chick ? utero-americans ?
do n't take him too seriously , a lot of what he say be intend a humour .
me neither , but he just light up when i laugh .
so , leonard , howard say you 're work on fundamental test of quantum mechanic .
oh , i find it fascinate . if i have n't go into microbiology , i probably would have go into physic . or ice dance .
that 's amaze .
be you go to try to set up the voltage use tunnel junction ?
oh , yeah , show me . in microbiology , the most excite thing i get to work with be yeast .
howard ?
yeah ?
your shoe be delightful . where do you get them ?
what ?
bazinga . i do n't care .
ha ! eat my dust , racially stereotypical plumber .
that 's not fair . i get stuck behind a tree .
and a cow and a penguin . face it dude , whether it 's a real car or a virtual cartoon car , you ca n't drive .
just need a little more practice .
what you need be cheat code , motor skill and a magic genie who grant wish to little boy who suck at mario kart .
it 's not about shoe , be it ? i do n't think i could go through that again .
then speak .
um , actually , can we do it in private ?
all right . go away . i agree , it 's rude , but she ask for privacy .
thanks , raj . okay , so here 's the thing , i be wonder if you could maybe teach me a little physic ?
a little physic ? there 's no such thing . physic encompasses the entire universe , from quantum particle to supernova , from spin electron to spin galaxy .
yeah , okay , cool . i do n't need the pb special , i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job . you know , like bernadette do .
why ca n't leonard teach you ?
‘ cause i want to surprise him .
ca n't you surprise him in some other way ? for example , i 'm sure he 'd be delightfully take aback if you clean your apartment .
come on , sheldon , this be important to me .
penny , this would be a massive undertaking , and my time be both limited and valuable .
you 're sit here play video game all day .
okay , point . what sort of foundation do you have ? do you take any science class in school ?
sure . i do the one with the frog .
the one with the frog .
yeah , actually , it be pretty cool . a lot of the girl threw up , but i gutted that thing like a deer .
i 'm sorry , penny , i do n't think so .
oh , come on ! a smart guy like you , it 'll be a challenge . you can make it like an experiment .
interest . i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla , i could teach you some rudimentary physic .
great ! it 's a little insult , but great . i 'll be koko .
not likely . koko learn to understand over _ word , not one of which have anything to do with shoe .
who be all those people ?
hi .
hey , look , it 's howard and his girlfriend bernadette .
he do n't mean salt mine . he mean where he work .
so , how 's your experiment go ?
boy , i 'd love to see that .
really ? oh , that 'd be great . how excite be that ?
do they have that ?
oh . you get me again . this be n't non-fat yogurt , this be fatty fat fat . excuse me .
sure .
thanks , honey . all right , what be your deal ?
excuse me ?
invite my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator ?
yeah ? so ?
wow ! you really be a piece of work . it 's not enough you get the prom queen , you have to get the head of the decorate committee , too ?
what be you talk about ?
do n't play innocent with me . i practically invent use fancy lab equipment to seduce woman .
have it ever work ?
not so far , but that 's not the point !
howard , relax , i 'm not interested in your girlfriend .
i hope not , because you do n't want to mess with me . i 'm crazy .
i believe you .
research journal , entry one . i 'm about to embark on one of the great challenge of my scientific career , teach penny physic . i 'm call it project gorilla .
hey , sheldon .
come in . take a seat . subject have arrive . i 've extend a friendly casual greet .
ready to get start ?
one moment . subject appear well-rested and enthusiastic . apparently , ignorance be bliss . all right , let u begin . where 's your notebook ?
um , i do n't have one .
how be you go to take note without a notebook ?
i have to take note ?
how else be you gon na study for the test ?
there 's gon na be a test ?
test . here . it 's college-ruled . i hope that 's not too intimidate .
twenty six hundred year ?
yeah , give or take . a i be say , it 's a warm summer even in ancient greece yes , penny ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
ca n't you hold it ?
not for twenty six hundred year .
howard ?
it unhooks in the front .
oh , that explains a lot .
howard , i 'm home !
of course .
that 's great , ma !
i guess i should go .
no , no , do n't move . hey , ma , can i have lamb stew for dinner ?
please ? i get a real hanker .
oh , i ca n't say no to my little tushy face . i 'll be back soon .
do you want the regular pea or the le seur ?
always le seur pea with lamb stew !
you 're right ! when you 're right , you 're right ! what if they 're out of the le seur ?
then get the regular !
all right ! you do n't have to yell !
you know , that one i get . howard , do you say something to leonard about me ?
he say if i go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out .
you 're not jealous of leonard , be you ?
no , fig newton be name after a small town in massachusetts . do n't write that down !
sorry .
now , if ma equal mg what do that imply ?
i do n't know .
how can you not know ? i just told you . have you suffer a recent blow to the head ?
hey ! you do n't have to be so mean !
i 'm sorry . have you suffer a recent blow to the head ?
no , you just suck at teach .
really ? of those two explanation , which one seem the most likely ?
oh , god , sheldon , look i 'm try to understand , but you 're go too fast . can you just back up a little bit ?
all right . it 's a warm summer even in ancient greece
not that far back !
okay ! at what point do you begin to feel lose ?
i do n't know . where be we look up at the night sky ?
damn it !
there 's no need to get frustrate , people learn at different rate . unlike object fall in a vacuum , which ? ma equal mg ?
square ?
no .
aristotle ?
no .
five ?
oh !
then i do n't know .
why be you cry ?
because i 'm stupid !
that 's no reason to cry . one cry because one be sad . for example , i cry because others be stupid and it make me sad .
okay , look , can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what leonard do ?
all right . leonard be attempt to learn why sub-atomic particle move the way they do .
it 's not . that 's why leonard do it .
okay , i just have one question . what exactly be sub-atomic particle ?
a good question .
thank you .
and to answer it , we first must ask ourselves , what be physic ?
it 's a warm summer even in ancient greece
okay , i get a bone to pick with you .
what do i do now ?
i be in bed with bernadette , and you text-blocked me .
what ?
we be completely naked , about to devour each other when , you text her that i have a problem with her hang out with you .
you do have a problem with her hang out with me .
what be i suppose to tell her ?
i do n't know , something that do n't make me come off a a petty , jealous douche .
and what would that be ?
hey , leonard . be i too late to see the experiment ? oh , hi .
what be you do here ?
no , you do n't . you say leonard 's experiment be stupid .
you told her my experiment be stupid ?
i be just repeat what sheldon say . let 's not get off topic , bernadette , i need to apologize . i be wrong to tell you who you should be friend with .
no , leonard , you should hear this .
okay , good , 'cause i be n't really gon na go .
look , i know i come off a confident and worldly , but the truth be i 'm not .
we 're shock .
or loud noise , clown and nun .
but i now realize how foolish that be .
he have a panic attack once when he get his head stuck in a sweater .
it be a full turtleneck . why be n't you help me ?
i do n't know . maybe because i 'm crazy ?
come here , tushy face .
raj , you should 've see leonard 's experiment . the interference pattern be so cool when the electron beam be on .
oh , i always tear up when the grinch 's heart grows three size .
tear seem appropriate . enlargement of the heart muscle , or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , be a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure .
fa-la-la , la-la-la , la-la-la .
i just love decorate the christmas tree . it make me feel like a little girl again .
we do n't have a tree when i be grow up .
mmm , in my family , holiday be n't so much celebrate a study for their anthropological and psychological implication on human society .
mmm , in a way . we present paper , and then broke off into focus group and critique each other .
so i take it you do n't want to help u trim the tree .
i do not . but if you insist on decorate a spider-infested fire hazard in my home i would request that you add this .
what be it ?
oh , sure , sure , yeah . very christmassy .
wait , excuse me , but it 's much more christmassy than anything you 've put on the tree .
merry newton-mas , everyone .
no . isaac go at the top of the tree .
no , he do n't .
i understand . you dispute newton 's claim that he invent calculus and you want to put gottfried leibniz on the top .
yeah , you get me . i 'm a leibniz man .
well , perhaps when your mother get here , she 'll talk some sense into you .
what ? your your mother 's come ? when ?
tomorrow .
um , tomorrow ?
why be you keep this a secret ?
if i can interject here , obviously leonard be concerned that his mother wo n't approve of you a his mate .
why would n't she approve of me ? i 'm adorable .
hey , it 's a big menu . there 's two page just for dessert .
i know . and those special , they change every day .
okay , you know what ? it 's lame when i say it , it 's just ridiculous when you pile on .
okay , sorry .
so what do she say when you told her we be go out ?
um
you do n't tell her we be go out , do you ?
um
why not ?
um
it be so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up .
no trouble at all .
yes , dear . mommy 's proud . i 've be meaning to thank you for your note on my paper disprove quantum brain dynamic theory .
my pleasure . for a non-physicist , you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipole in the brain 's water molecule could not possibly form a bose condensate .
wait , wait , wait . when do you send my mom note on a paper ?
oh , do i thank you for the flower ?
i do n't really like flower .
it be , be n't it ?
yes , and sheldon sent me flower .
then what be all that wait , wait , wait about ?
well , i would assume it 's because sheldon and i stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect , while you avoid me , due to unresolved childhood issue .
yes , but we be on the subject , so i 'm oblige to ask , leonard , how be you ?
mmm , menopausal .
have you heard your brother have gotten engage ?
no . sheldon , why do n't you tell me ?
she 's a remarkable girl . the young appeal court judge in new jersey and a two-time olympic bronze medallist .
why ? i 'm not marry her . so , how about you ? be you see anyone interest ?
not the time , sheldon .
so , howard , have you and rajesh finally summon the courage to express your latent homosexual feeling toward one another ?
why not ?
i see .
and where be she this even ?
honest to god . leonard , tell her i have a girlfriend .
i do n't know what you 're talk about .
what do you mean you do n't know what i 'm talk about ? tell her i have a girlfriend !
all right . he “ have ” a “ girlfriend . ”
howard , keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct , the more you 're hurt your partner .
do you really think your lip in my ear be help ?
hi . sorry i 'm late .
oh , yes , the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issue . have he finally come to term with his little slugger grow breast ?
well , he sent me a football and a catcher 's mitt for christmas , so i 'm go to say no .
classic overcompensation . oh , speak of father , leonard , that reminds me , i 'm divorce yours .
yes . he be cheat on me .
yes , with some waitress from the university cafeteria . can you believe it ? a waitress ? oh , no offense , dear .
no , it sound like a compliment .
mmm , well , let 's see . sheldon , when do i leave leonard 's father ?
mitzy 's dead ?
she be old and blind , leonard . what choice do we have ?
excuse me , leonard , i be the one who 's get a divorce , mitzy be the one who be dead . why be you the one make a fuss ?
so , penny , what 's new in your life ?
thank you for drive me back to my hotel .
i be go to ask leonard to do it , but he seem a bit emotionally unstable and you do n't want someone like that operating heavy machinery .
your check engine light be on .
oh , not at all . but i be a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that 's not subject to regular maintenance .
well , initially i felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger , but that 's the natural reaction of the limbic system to be betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch .
thankfully , my shock be somewhat mitigate by the fact that i have n't have intercourse with him in eight year .
that 's exactly what i say during orgasm . yikes .
oh , i do n't drink .
i do , i 'll teach you .
leonard ? leonard ? leonard ?
what be it ?
i make tea .
i do n't want tea .
i do n't make tea for you . this be my tea .
then why be you tell me ?
that 's a lousy conversation starter .
oh , be it ? we 're converse . checkmate .
what do you want , sheldon ?
what i want be to be depart the starship enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft head to the planetoid i rule know a sheldon alpha five .
thank you , that 's very comfort .
that 's not the comfort part .
you 're right , i do feel well .
well , the german have always be a comfort people . just remember , leonard , where your biological family have fail you , you always have me , your surrogate family .

if it 's any consolation , i 'm not happy about it either . good night .
yikes .
yes . if a little be good , more must be well .
what ?
really ? which one ?
well , that 's convenient . how do his penis turn out ?
oh , fair enough . what can you tell me , if anything , about that busboy 's penis ?
really ? well , that mean he 's either embarrass about the relationship or he do n't care enough about his mother to tell her he 's in one . either way , one of u should be insult .
sonny boy !
get out here ! your mommy want to talk to you !
what the hell be go on ?
why do n't you tell me you be tap my homegirl ? do i say that right ?
yeah , not bad , not bad .

i be a scientist . i never apologize for the truth .
that 's my spot .
i ca n't wait to ask stan lee why he insists on give all his character first and last name that start with the same letter .
oh , come on , why would you do that ?

plus , you do n't get to meet stan lee .
okay , that 's enough , howard . the poor guy 's have a tough time . he have to spend the entire afternoon in jail wear that suit .

he say we could call him stan .
except for raj .
well , i hope you 're satisfied , penny . you be responsible for all the evil that have befallen me today .

anyway , we follow the guy to this garage sale , and they have the coolest stuff .
they be closing up . we get this whole box for sixty buck .
we do n't even get to go through it all . there could be anything in here .

it appear to be a lord of the ring ring .
oh .
it 's even get the elvish engrave on it .
it 's not elvish . it 's the language of mordor write in elvish script . one ring to rule them all .
one ring to find them .
one ring to bring them all .
and in the darkness bind them .
holy crap , be we nerdy .
so , i be do some check on the ring .
seedy underbelly ?
you know , your black market phasers , your screen-worn lieutenant uhura panty , that kind of stuff .

who else could it be ? it have to be eddie crispo .
i know lot of dangerous people , okay ?

eddie crispo . anyway , he say this be n't a replica . it 's the real deal .
if you 're suggest that that be the actual ring of power forge by sauron in mount doom , i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement .
mine !
no , it be not yours . we all go in on the box together .
well , yes , but i found it in the box , and the law of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure be the owner of the treasure .
how be this maritime salvage ?
other than the lack of water , how be it not ?
wait , wait . sheldon , stop be crazy for a second . how much be something like this worth ?
well , it 's tough to say since it 's hot , but on the underground market , my guy figure
yes . he figure ten , maybe _ thousand .
okay , that 's a lot of money . the wise thing to do be invest it in something practical . like a jet ski .
why do you want a jet ski ?
all the wealthy and beautiful people in movie ride jet ski . that ca n't just be a coincidence .
we ca n't sell it . we have to keep it and love it and polish it , and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scene from the movie .
it 's sad how great that sound .
there be no jewish hobbit .
clearly , you 've never be to my house for dinner on rosh hashanah .
we be not blackmailing peter j all right , where 's the ring ?
you mean my ring ?
what be you do ?
the ring be unguarded , it be just sit on the table , anyone could have take it . proof ? i do .

look , let 's be reasonable . we all want to do different thing with the ring , but your idea be stupid , and i want a jet ski .
you always get your way .
i 'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring .
hey , guy . enjoy your food that i actually brought you instead of promising food , but bring you a box of random crap ?
yeah , it 's delicious , the sarcasm 's a little stale , though . hey , how about this ? until we figure out what to do with the ring , penny hold on to it .
what ring ?
this ring .
look for something ?
why ?
it 's a prop from a movie , and we 're kind of fight over it .
okay , just to be clear , the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend give me be a prop from a movie , and i do n't even get to keep it ?
if you have go out with me three year ago , by now , you 'd have my great aunt ida 's brooch that she smuggle out of occupy belgium in a cat .
how be i look now ?

what be that ?
that 's my girl .
gentleman , have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action be to sell the ring and divide the money ?
no .
greeting from mumbai . i be raj 's attorney , venkatesh koothrappali .
also my cousin .
do n't answer that . i 'll get straight to the point . my client 's prepared to surrender any interest he have in the ring in exchange for two kawasaki jet ski .
look , we 're big boy , why do n't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle ? one kawasaki jet ski , do and do .
all right , forget the jet ski .

what 's your point ?
my point be , if i be a horse or a bird , i 'd be very nervous around james cameron .
it amazes me how you constantly ob over fictional detail when there be more important thing in the real world to worry about . for example , why be n't william shatner in the new star trek movie ?
oh , i 'm so glad you ask it like that . you .
i won ?
well , good for him .

i 'm not go to punch you .
that 's what my sister use to say .
do you want to do this or not ?

rabbit do have a respiratory system that would support great size . and on a side note , they be one of the few mammal whose scrotum be in front of the penis .
maybe that 's what they want to talk about .
leonard , where do you stand on giant rabbit and scrotal position ?
i honestly do n't care .
really ? because every time we 've talk about unusual animal genitals , you 've always have some pretty strong and controversial opinion .
what do you want from me ? i just do n't give a rat 's as .
would that be a giant rat 's as ?
for the record , giant rat be possible .
can we please talk about something else ? maybe something vaguely related to life a we know it on this planet ?
okay , how about this for a topic , why be leonard be a giant douche ? assume giant douche be possible .
of course they be . leonard 's be one .
maybe he 's have a lover 's spat with penny .
no , there be no spat .
oh , but something happen .
i do n't want to talk about it .
but i sense you 're go to and i do n't want to hear about it . excuse me .
what 'd you do , romeo ? you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she be in the mood for a short stack ?
do you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panty and jump around , but it wound up just creep her out ?
what ? no .
oh . ouch .
that be what be refer to a a burn on you .
do you ask her to start wax ?
no .
do you start wax ?
no .
while make love , do you accidentally spank your own as and cry out mommy ?
i 'm walk away from you now .
that be n't a no .
yeah , i think we 're get close .
do you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her ? because you can die that way .
oh , that would be a good way to go .
hi .
oh , hey .

oh , right , bowling .
you do n't have to come if you do n't want to .
no , no , it 's okay . i mean , let 's face it , you guy would get cream without me .

it 's always nice chat with you , sheldon .
sarcasm ?
thinly veil contempt .
remember , seven o'clock .
get it .
bite me !
please reserve that butch spirit for the lane .
i thought you be bring your own bowling shoe .

i 'm sure you 're probably sick of star trek question , but , whoopi goldberg , you ever hit that ?
ah , beer . the magic elixir that can turn this poor , shy indian boy into the life of the party . oh , yeah .
chilli cheese fry ?
yes . i love chilli cheese fry .
really ? you love them ?
yeah , why ?
no reason . i 'm just glad to hear you 're comfortable say you love something .
do you really want to get into this right now ?
get into what ? why would n't you love the chilli cheese fry ? they 've be in your life a long time . they make you happy . they deserve to know .
okay , look , you just caught me by surprise last night . i do n't know what to say .
okay , well , now you 've have some time to think about it . so , what do you want to say ?
i 'm not sure .
how can you not be sure ?
okay , this be n't the place to have this conversation .
no , the place to have the conversation be in bed after i say , i love you , and you say , thank you , good night .
do n't push it , leonard .
i be not push anything .
you be . you do n't get to decide when i 'm ready to say i love you !
ah , the premature i love you .
i guess premature . do that count ?
penny , penny , penny .
what ?
this be for you .
ice cream ?
i 've be familiarize myself with female emotional crisis by study the comic strip cathy . when she 's upset , she say ach and eats ice cream .
um , ach .
if you be a cat , i would have brought you a lasagna .
do leonard send you over here ?
no , we have n't spoken since your abrupt departure last night cause u to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton .
yeah , i 'm sorry about that .
i 'm not too proud to admit that i cry myself to sleep .
again , i 'm sorry .
and let me tell you sleep do not come easily with leonard in the next room sing along with alanis morrisette .
you 're kid .
no . clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream .
all right , sheldon , what part of this be suppose to make me feel well ?
the part where i tell you i 've engineer a rematch with stuart 's team for tonight .
oh , honey , i do n't know . thing be a little weird with leonard right now .
you want me to remove him from the team ? i 'm the captain , i can do that .
no , no , that 's okay . just let me talk to him , and i 'll get back to you .
when be you go to talk to him ?
i do n't know .
he 's in the laundry room now . now would be a good time .
you 're not gon na leave me alone until i do it , be you ?
oh , i think we both know the answer to that question .
i think we should talk now .
really ? i would n't know what that 's like .
i 'm sorry . you know what i 'm talk about , though .
yeah , i do .
so , we 're good ?
yes , that 's what i 'm tell you . we be good . we be great .
all right ! fence mend , problem swept under the rug . time to bowl ! yes , i be eavesdropping , there 's a lot at stake here .
the wesley crusher ?
no , not the wesley crusher . the wesley “ crusher . ”
i do n't get it .
wesley crusher be wil wheaton 's character on star trek .
still do n't get it .
it 's a blindingly clever play on word . by appropriate his character 's name and add the s , we imply that we we 'll be the crusher of wesley .
what ? no ! again , it 's not the wesley crusher . it 's the wesley “ crusher . ”
you know , if you want it to mean you 're crush wesley , it 'd be the “ wesley ” crusher .
hey , look . they name their team after me .
so , we 're all clear on the bet and the stake ?
hey , sheldon , i just want you to know that i 'm really look forward to wipe the floor with you .
after you .
it 's customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first .
it 's a custom , not a rule .
that 's right , sheldon . embrace the dark side .
i , um , i want you to know that even though we 're on opposite side , i , i bear you no ill will .
be the ball , howard .
leave me alone , sheldon .
you be n't the ball .
this be fun , huh ?
it 's good that we get out and do something physical .
yeah , that 's right .
shel-don ! shel-don ! shel-don ! shel-don !
the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball !
i 'm glad you patch thing up with your boyfriend .
it 's always tough when the l bomb get drop and you 're not ready for it .
i date this one girl , and i told her that i love her , and she say she be n't sure . and she strung me along for almost two year . it be brutal .
thanks . yeah , i wish she have just broken up with me right there , put me out of my misery .
oh , that 's me .
do you let wil wheaton get in your head ?
what be you talk about ?
he 's evil . he play evil mind game . do he tell you his grandmother die ?
no !
yes !
enjoy the accolade now , wil wheaton , but like your time on star trek : next generation , your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived .
penny , you 're up .

yeah , i get it .
i know .
i 'm not pressure you .
yeah , you be ! just back off !

wait ! where be you go ? penny , come back ! i 'll get you ice cream !
no , let her go .
be you insane ? if she leaf , it 's over !
do you think i would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match ?
good . keep think that .
i do n't know about you , but i feel empower .
sheldon , you 're wrong . wolverine be not born with bone claw .
howard , you know me to be a very smart man . do n't you think if i be wrong , i 'd know it ?
give it up , dude , you 're argue with a crazy person .
i 'm not crazy . my mother have me test .
hey , guy .
what be you do here ?
what do you mean ? it 's new comic book night .
there 's more to life than sex , raj .
okay , who have leonard flame out with penny in less than _ hour ” ?
nothing flame out . we do n't have to have sex every night , you know .
you do n't have to , but it 's highly recommend .
yeah , take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slam shut on your little dinky .
it 's not a matter of opportunity . we 're get to know each other . there 's a learn curve .
what 's there to learn ? you get naked , do nasty thing to each other , then somebody make scramble egg and salami . easy peasy .
okay , who have leonard get a floppy disk ?
oh , a clever , albeit obsolete , euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ .
nothing like that happen , all right ? the sex be just fine .
just fine ? oh , dude , the fourth harry potter movie be just fine .
i 'm not say it be bad , i 'm just say it be n't great .
okay , when you say “ it be n't great , do you mean for both of you ? because we can totally see it not be great for her . be i right ?
oh , yeah .
to tell you the truth , i think we be both a little , i do n't know
disappointed ? let down ?
ashamed ? horrify ? repulse ?
all i know be , it be n't the way i dream it would be .
sex be never the way i dream it 's gon na be .
sheldon , dinner 's here .
tandoori palace ?
no , we go somewhere new .
you 're good-naturedly rib me , be n't you ?
no , look , mumbai palace .
why ? why would we change ? we have a perfectly good palace . tandoori palace be our palace .
trust me , this will be just fine .
you be the authority on just fine .
what 's that suppose to mean ?
yeah , exactly . not bad , but not great .
i do n't know
i know . a i 'm sure you 're aware
okay , yeah , well , i 'm just gon na go eat my dinner elsewhere . maybe an airplane head for a mountainside .
penny , wait . aagh ! what be wrong with you ?
i sense i may have cross some sort of line .
yeah , you
ugh , i be so embarrass !
please do n't be mad .
what do you tell them ?

you know , i think this be one of those thing where talk about it be not go to make it well . want a glass of wine ?
okay . see , we should 've do this last night , you know , have a little wine , take the edge off .
actually , ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cell and stimulates reuptake receptor of inhibitory neurotransmitter like gamma-aminobutyric acid .
do n't talk , just drink .
no , you 're misunderstand . a shiksa goddess be n't an actual goddess and we do n't pray to them , we prey on them .
whatever , dude . the point be , leonard 's get one and you do n't .
what 's that ?
sound like a cricket .
hang on . base on the number of chirp per minute and the ambient temperature in this room , it be a snowy tree cricket .
how do you know what the exact temperature of the room be ?
under the term of my roommate agreement with leonard , i 've have unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of _ .
okay , you be right about wolverine and bone claw , but you 're wrong about the cricket .
oh , dude , you be never get a shiksa goddess .
that be a snowy tree cricket . oecanthus fultoni . i be do with latin by fifth grade .
okay , okay , tell you what . i be willing to bet anything that 's an ordinary field cricket .
i ca n't take your money .
chicken ca n't climb tree
thank god .
okay , i believe a chicken make you his bitch . but the cricket thing , i do n't buy . bet me .
fair enough . what stake do you propose ?
i will put up my fantastic four number _ , first appearance of silver surfer against your flash _ , the classic flash of two world issue .
all right , you have a wager .
hmm .
great . now how be you go to settle it , hmm ? there be no way to determine the specie of the cricket without examine it .
i wonder what the non-pathetic people be do tonight .
more wine ?
hit me .
i do n't see anything .
shh !
one at a time . what be that ?
my stomach . indian food do n't agree with me . ironic , be n't it ?
shh ! elevator shaft .
help me open it .
be you crazy ? we ca n't go down an empty elevator shaft .
fine , if you do n't want to proceed , then you forfeit the bet , and i 'll take possession of your fantastic four .
let 's open her up .
be you bother that i can so easily manipulate you ?
ooh , big talk from a man who be once treed by a chicken .

what would you name him ?
hang on . voila , the snowy tree cricket , aka oecanthus fultoni , which be latin for i 'll suck nothing . of course i 'm joking because the latin for that be nihil exsorbibo .
that be not toby , this be toby . raj , what do you think ?
oh , i really do n't care anymore
god , i have the most horrible night .
what happen ?
obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess .
shiksa . shik-sa .
forgive me . yiddish be not spoken in east texas . and if it be , it be n't spoken for long .
yeah , fine , whatever . the point be , you 're wrong again .
all right . tell you what , let 's go down to the entomology department and let professor crawley tell u what kind of cricket toby be .
he 's a snowy tree cricket , and his name be jiminy .
i bet i could throw a rock in this room and come up with three well friend .

i just say that . this conversation have start to circle . meeting adjourn .

leonard , it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial . i lose a bet to wolowitz .
right , right . you 're say you talk to penny ?
yes .
interest .
hardly .
excuse me .
little bit .
oh , hey .
hey . uh , what do sheldon say to you ?

oh , yes . it be a lot of work to accommodate you in my life . i 'd hate for that effort to have be in vain .
right .
just to be clear do i have to stop say coitus with everyone or just you ?
harsh term . but all right , i 'll just substitute intercourse .
or fornication . yeah . but that have judgmental overtone , so i 'll hold that in reserve .

nevertheless , i 'd like to get one on the record so you can understand why i do what i do .
i 'm listen .
she let me .
it 's just two degree , sheldon . i just want to turn up the thermostat two degree !
: let me point out that two degree can be the difference between water and steam .

: i do n't have to go to hell . at _ degree , i 'm there already !
leonard .
hang on .
can i sleep on your couch tonight ?
uh , well , you can try , but the people across the hall be be very noisy .
apparently , the one fella try to adjust the thermostat , then the other fella go bat-crap crazy .
so you agree , he 's nut .
well , not a nut a the guy who chooses to live with him .
believe it or not , he be bad when i met him .
oh , i do not believe that .
you be so naive . just like i be seven year ago . i 'd just start at the university .
oh , i bet you 're here to check out the room for rent .
run away , dude .
run fast , run far .
that should have be my first clue .
so sheldon 's last roommate try to warn you off ?
for all i knew , he be the crazy one . he have this really derange look .
well , yeah , he 'd be living with sheldon .
yeah ?
no , you want the crazy guy across the hall .
in retrospect , that be clue number two .
yes ?
i know what i say . i know what you say . i know what my mother say on march _ , _ . what be the sixth noble gas ?
what ?
you say you 're a scientist . what be the sixth noble gas ?
uh , radon ?
be you ask me or tell me ?
tell you ? tell you .
all right , next question . kirk or picard ?
oh , uh , well , that 's tricky . um , well , uh , original series over next generation , but picard over kirk .
correct . you 've pass the first barrier to roommate-hood . you may enter .
oh , this be pretty nice . uh , the bedroom be back there ?
that depends .
i do n't understand , their , their existence be conditional ?
no , but your ability to perceive their existence be conditional on you passing the second and third barrier .
each more daunt than the last . have a seat .
okay .
no ! that 's where i sit !
cathedra mea , regulae meae . that 's latin for my chair , my rule . now , you say on the phone that your area of study be physic .
uh , yeah , experimental physic .
hmm .
what be that ?
do n't concern you . you 'll be go to the university every day ?
and you have a vehicle ?
and you 'll be willing to drive me ?
well , ca n't you drive ?
i can . i choose not to .
okay , i suppose i could drive you . well that 's a point in my favour , right ?
why do n't you let me do this .
come on , i just ask .
last question . in a post-apocalyptic world , which task would you assign the high priority ? locate a sustainable food source , re-establishing a function government , procreate , or preserve the knowledge of mankind ?
uh , i 'm gon na go with preserve the knowledge .
that 's correct . fyi , i would have accepted any answer other than procreate . come , i 'll show you the rest of the apartment .
oh , good . i pass the barrier .
the second barrier . do n't get cocky . this be the bathroom . be you fairly regular ?
uh , i guess .
this be n't go to work if you 're guess . when do you evacuate your bowel ?
when i have to .
when you have to ? i 'm sorry , i do n't rent to hippy .
i ca n't give you eight . i can give you seven thirty .
third barrier pass . you have won the right to see your room . huzzah !
be this it ?
no , this be my room . people do n't go in my room .
so where do you sleep ?
i do n't understand .
if people do n't go in there , and you 're people , and you be people , be n't you ? make a joke .
do you do this often ?
on occasion .
no , i do n't just move in . first we have to iron out a few detail .
we have a flag ?
never fly it upside down unless the apartment 's in distress . and next , if either of u ever invents time travel , we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five second .
okay .
well that 's disappoint .
it be the best apartment i 'd see , the rent be very reasonable and after you 've pass the first three barrier you kind of want to take it all the way .
well , i 'm sorry , leonard , it 's very hard to feel sympathy for you .
okay , how about this ? let me tell you about the first time i brought a girl over .
leonard ?
shh . just pretend we 're not here .
leonard ? leonard ?
i 'm sure he 'll go away .
that 's it ! i 'm out of here !
but , joyce , come on .

oh , my god .
actually , i could n't get too mad at him about joyce kim .
why not ?
what do that have to do with joyce kim ?
a it turn out , she be a north korean spy . luckily , sheldon drove her out before i reveal anything important . which i 'm not say i would have .
so , what , that 's it ? you 've stayed with sheldon all this time because he kept you from go to federal prison ?
that be part of it . the other part be what happen with the elevator .
oh , yeah , i 'm wonder about that . you say it be work when you move in .
it be , but one night , sheldon come home from work
what be go on here ?
hey .
i ca n't speak for these guy , but i 'm sit on my tushie . it 's a joke .

oh , well , there be some people on the first floor move out , and they sell it to me for a hundred dollar . howard and raj help me bring it up .
but what 's wrong with the furniture we have ?
do it occur to you that be by design ?
accord to the roommate agreement , i 'm entitle to allocate _ % of the cubic footage of the common area .
oh , you do , do you ? oh , drat ! hoist by my own spam filter .
what be i do in your spam folder ?
i put you there after you forward me a picture of a cat play the piano , entitle this be funny .
oh , yeah , i saw that . that be hilarious .
okay , what do all this have to do with the elevator ?
i 'm get to it .
i assure you , you 'll be sorry you waste your money on an ipod when microsoft come out with theirs .
okay , do you have an opinion about everything ?
yes .
and you just assume you 're always right ?
it 's not an assumption . change seat with me .
i do n't like this spot . i have to keep turn my head .
ooh , it 's time for babylon _ !
we do n't watch babylon _ in this apartment .
why not ?
because no one like babylon _ .
i like it .
me , too .
so do i .
there you go three against one .
they do n't get a vote . it 's one against one . and accord to the roommate agreement , all tie will be settle by me .
but i say no to that .
and i say yes . and i settle all tie . change seat with me .
why ?
there 's a draft on my neck over here .
so , i get the draft ?
you 're protect by your turtleneck .
fine . and it 's a dickey .
hmm , i 'm still not comfortable . of course . there 's too many people here .
we can fix that . let 's leave .
yeah , we can go over to my place .

well , it turn out i have a little rocket fuel in the apartment .
be we ever go to get to the elevator ?

the trick be to mix it into tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over _ kilonewtons of thrust .
nice .

excuse me , but i 've be work on this a long time . trust me , it 'll work .
you do n't see your mistake , do you ?

give me that .
what 'd you do that for ? i have plenty of time .
you 're welcome .
not only do sheldon save my life , he do n't rat me out to the landlord . or the police . or homeland security .
okay , so , basically , you 're the reason i have to walk up and down three flight of stair every day ?
so i do something stupid . i 'm sure you do stupid thing when you be young . what be you do seven year ago ?
excuse me , i be in high school . study , keep my nose clean , do volunteer work for the community .

there 's doubt ?
i do agree to the thermostat set , and i should n't have try to change it .

that 's a bazinga , right ?
one of my best , do n't you think ?
howard , do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser ? we need it lock onto the sea of tranquility .
you get it . oh , raj , no . billion of dollar have go into invent the internet and fill it with picture of naked woman , so we do n't have to peep through window .
it 's not like that , i 'm watch someone 's tv . the good wife be on . i tell you , this be my new grey 's anatomy .

sheldon , the world be fill with dirty discard sock .
not my world .
hey , you know who 'd really dig see this experiment ? penny .

why do n't you ask her to come up ?

four thirty .
that 's not afternoon . that 's preevning .

right , okay . what be you do tomorrow preevning ?
okay , what if i be to tell you , tomorrow , at _ you could meet a woman who have be scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate ?
and that 's exactly the answer we give to the question , what be your attitude towards online date ”
howard want to write mumbo jumbo , but i say no , our sheldon would say hokum .
well , come on , where 's your scientific curiosity ?
well , most of it be be apply to unravel the secret of the universe while the rest of it 's wonder why i 'm have this conversation with you .
okay , how about this . even spock have a date once every seven year .
he do n't date . it be pon farr . his blood boil with mating lust .
okay , well , why do n't you start with a cup of coffee , and you can pon farr amy farrah fowler later .
i do n't drink coffee .
all right , you can have a hot chocolate .
a i will not be engage in this nonsense , my choice of beverage be moot . but for the record , i only drink hot chocolate in month with an r in them .
why ?
what 's life without whimsy ?
okay , i 'm out .
sheldon , i 've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment . unless you be willing to come with u to meet this girl , it will remain there forever .
you 're bluffing .
be you willing to risk it ?
curse you .
oh . hey , leonard .
i be a perfectly happy , geeky , little lonely guy , and you ruin me !
be you drunk ?
come on . we 're gon na have sex , and it 's not gon na mean a thing !
haughty derision it be .
interest . my mother and i have the same agreement about church .
i do n't object to the concept of a deity , but i 'm baffle by the notion of one that take attendance .

note . now , before this go any far , you should know that all form of physical contact up to and include coitus be off the table .
may i buy you a beverage ?

that reminds me , i have a bone to pick with you .

leonard , a pact be a pact . you have to get penny to fix me up .
it 's not that simple . what be i suppose to say ? penny , do you have any friend you 'd like to never hear from again ?

okay , we go out a little bit , a long time ago , but we be never like go out .
okay , not to be pedantic , but the last i checked go out be in fact the past tense of go out , which i think we all know be a popular euphemism for saw each other naked .
i 'll just roll for you .
do you have a problem with justin stay with me ?
what be your first clue ?
uh-oh ! industrial accident .
you know what ? do n't talk to me like i 'm an idiot .

i heard of 'em . do n't know they be a band . sheldon , she 's go . you can turn off the blender .
have your relationship reach it inevitable ugly end ?
no , we just have a little spat .
look on the bright side . a the result of penny 's forfeit , you have become the world 's first winner of research lab . would you like a commemorative snow cone ?
hey , i thought of a game we can play in the car .
an old boyfriend who 's definitely not gay . that 's what a guy like to hear , definitely .
all right , i 'll start with an easy one , um , isaac newton , madame curie and niels bohr .
and then i say one little thing and i end up be the bad guy !

thanks , stuart . let me ask you something . do you think it 's okay for penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch ?
no , i mean , she 's obviously way out of line .
come on . at the very least , when she found out leonard be upset about it , she should 've back off .
you mean like when a guy 's upset because his friend agree to take a cooking class with him and then do n't show up because he 's do a juice fast with his mother ?
i do n't know you be upset about that .

i have a few question . first , i notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich ?
yes .
where exactly do the half-sandwich come from ? be you give me half of someone else 's sandwich , or do i have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half ?
no , no , sheldon , they just make a half-sandwich .
you ca n't make a half-sandwich . if it 's not half of a whole sandwich , it 's just a small sandwich .
okay , fine , it 's soup and a small sandwich . be that what you want ?

leonard be wrong .
i 'm come . goodbye , sheldon . what do you mean , transgression i 've commit ?
like what ? yeah , yeah , i see you , you 're make a little cheque sign in the air , i get it , just hold your horse . what do leonard complain about ?
your drive , the plethora of stuffed animal on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activity , your constant tardiness , your sing .
my sing ?
that 's actually from my list , but leonard would be a fool if he do n't agree with it .
okay , if leonard have so many problem with me , why have n't he just say so ?
because , accord to him , you 're oversensitive and have a temper .
oh , really ? well , then , do me a favour and tell leonard that he can drop dead !
and she wonder why she 's constantly undertipped .
hey .
oh , good , you 're home . i need you to do me a favour .

what ?
right now would be good .
leonard !
i hear you do n't like my stuffed animal , my drive or my punctuality .
what ? who would tell you something like that ? why would you tell her something like that ?

for god 's sake , i do n't need to hear that ! ca n't you just say , i 'm busy ?
i say i 'm busy , but that be n't good enough for you !
you know what ? i hope it 's one of those home invasion deal , and they shoot me in the head .
well , if it 's a home invader , do n't tell them i 'm on the toilet !
yeah , he 's , uh , over in the graphic novel section . built himself a little nest .

be everything okay ?
uh , sheldon told me you and leonard be have a fight ?
oh , good , good . i love you .
i 'm not leave until you talk to me .

we meet again .
so what do justin say when you told him he could n't sleep on your couch ?
he 's a musician . he 'll sleep in his own vomit , if he have to .
i should have ask for much more than a comic book and a robot .
how much time do we have ?
uh , t-minus five hour , _ minute to onset of meteor shower .
okay , our position be _ degree north , _ west . that mean the azimuth should be _ degree relative to magnetic north with an elevation of _ .
anything yet ?
uh , we have a signal , but there 's no frame lock .
ooh , real sex .
big deal . every time i watch that show it 's old woman put condom on cucumber .
alright , let 's see what 's on the east coast feed .
oh , hey . dune .

all right . let it never be say that sheldon lee cooper ignore the plea of a damsel in distress .
no one 's say that . let 's go .

i wish penny do n't have to work , she love camp .
yeah , that would have be great . you and penny have sex in the tent while i sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus .

amy point out that between the two of u , our genetic material have the potential of produce the first in a line of intellectually superior , benign overlord to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow .

you do n't even like people touch you . how be you go to have sex ?
why on earth would we have sex ?

yeah .
i ca n't date amy .
why not ?
she 's not my girlfriend .
okay , look , do n't think of it a date a girlfriend . think of it a , uh , get to know the future mother of your child .
oh . i have n't consider that . i suppose she will have to have access to our progeny . and you do n't think i can achieve the require intimacy via text message ?

hurry . we 're go to be late .
sheldon , do it ever occur to you that i might have other plan ?

i have a master 's degree and two doctorate . the thing i should know , i do know .
my point be , i know more about date than you , and if you be a smart a you think you be , you would listen to me .
if you know so much , how come i have a date tonight and you have nothing well to do than drive me to it ?
fair point .
you know , there 's something i 've always wonder about aquaman .
yeah ?
what ?
so , um , amy , sheldon tell me you 're a neuro something-or-other .
neurobiologist . your check engine light be on .
yeah , it 's okay .
but the light indicates

all right . it be hell .
any follow up , amy ?
no .
i myself grow up in nebraska . small town outside of omaha . you know , nice place , mostly family farm , a few meth lab .
i 'm sorry , how be this well than uncomfortable silence ?
i do n't know . i be just try something .
muggles .
yes .
penis first ?
yes . now , help me !
i 'd suggest a lubricant , but i have a feel you fell on some of that a well .
not funny , leonard .
really ? a robot hand 's get a death grip on your junk , dude . that 's funny , ask anyone .
please , before my mother walk in , just get this off me !
okay , let 's see .
no , no ! do n't touch , the program be pause .
well , then let 's un-pause it .
no , no ! i load the wrong program . the hand think it 's hold a screwdriver in outer space . if you continue the program , it 's gon na start twist .
a-all right , um , how about this . when , when winnie the pooh get his head stuck in the honey tree , his friend all grabbed onto him and pull and pull .
you do what you want , i 'm not touch another man 's honey tree .
all right , uh , forget pull . how about we get an electric saw and cut it off ?
what ? no saw ! one circumcision be enough .
how about an acetylene torch ?
well , then what do you want u to do ?
howard , i make cooky for you and your little friend !
i 'll bring them up with some hawaiian punch !
why not ? ! be you ashamed of your mother ? !
yes , but that 's not the point ! get me out of here .
hey , here 's another possible topic of conversation . this be a big night for sheldon . right , sheldon ?
big night ? the winter solstice be a big night . it 's over _ hour in southern california .
that 's an amuse factoid .
thank you .
no , no . my point be , uh , tonight be sheldon 's first official date . discus .
be this true ?
apparently , a semi-incestuous teen for jesus fourth of july hoedown do n't count .
uh , yeah , i would n't say many . a few . . what 's
your characterization of approximately _ different men a a few .
whoa , wait , wait , wait . i do not start date at _ .
i 'm sorry . _ ?
_ .
my mistake . now , assume the left side of a bell curve peak around the present , that would bring the total up to _ men . plus or minus eight men .
remarkable . do you have sexual intercourse with all of these men ?
no .
although that number would be fairly easy to calculate .
oh .
base on the number of awkward encounter i 've have with strange men leave her apartment in the morning , plus the number of time she 's return home wear the same clothes she wore the night before
okay , sheldon , i think you 've make your point .
so we multiply _ , minus _ men before the loss of virginity , so _ time _ give u _ sexual partner . let 's round that up to _ .
okay , sheldon , you be so wrong . that be not even close to the real number . i 'm gon na need a drink over here .
this be very interest . cultural perception be subjective . penny , to your mind , be you a slut ?
no ! no ! no . let 's just all finish our dinner , okay ?
this be an interest topic . how many sexual encounter have you have ?
do volunteer for a scientific experiment in which orgasm be achieve by electronically stimulate the pleasure centre of the brain count ?
i should think so .
then _ .
do n't tug . no tug .
next time , take your own advice .
my , my , my . what do we have here ?
yeah , we get that a lot . what be this ?
where 's the rest of the robot ?
‘ cause that 's all you need , right ?
all right , all right . hang on , stay calm . i need an orderly with a wheelchair . i get a robot hand grasp a man 's penis out here .
i 'm sorry , we do n't have a code for robot hand grasp a man 's penis . why be it hooked up to a computer ?
uh , it 's what control the arm .
do you try turn it off and back on again ?
no , you see , it 's more complicate than that . no , wait ! winnie the pooh be out of the honey tree .
now can we have cooky and hawaiian punch ?
you be right . this be a very productive even . i saw a whole new side of amy farrah fowler tonight .
and that be ?
use in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny .
you 're still on that ?
that 's no threat . my mother 's always want a grandchild .
really ? your deeply religious born-again christian mother want a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock ?
curse .
if i 'd thought of that in the first place , i could 've save myself this whole night .
hey , howard , what 's up ?
i 've decide not to procreate .
clarify something for me . be n't the point of a communal meal the exchange of idea and opinion ? an opportunity to consider important issue of the day ?
it be . you just kind of put a damper on thing when you say , the next person i see talk with food in their mouth will be put to death .
well , we could argue about who say what all night long , but to set thing back on course , i will propose a new topic of conversation .
great .
what be the best number ? by the way , there 's only one correct answer .
five million , three hundred eighteen thousand and eight ?
wrong . the best number be _ . you 're probably wonder why .
no .
uh-uh .
we get it . _ be the chuck norris of number .
chuck norris wish . in binary , _ be a palindrome , one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards be one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one , exactly the same . all chuck norris backwards get you be sirron kcuhc .
just for the record , when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator , upside-down it spell booby .
remember when you be wonder why the girl do n't want to eat with u tonight ?
yeah , i get it now .
oh , thanks . howard give it to me . it 's the cutest thing . every time i have dinner with his mom , the next day i get jewellery .
do you know that the iconic valentine 's heart shape be not actually base on the shape of a human heart , but rather on the shape of the buttock of a female bending over ?
hey , penny , how 's it go ?
my dad 's company print the menu for this place . i 'm just drop off some new one laminate . make 'em easy to clean if people throw up on 'em . guess how i get the idea ?
okay , well , it be good to see you .
he 's really cute . how do you know him ?
oh , we go out a couple of time .
yes .
no , no . but in this case , yes .
interest . and be it not satisfactory ?
could n't you just fool around with him and then listen to npr ?
it 's what i do with howard . i 'm much smarter than he be . but it 's important to protect his manhood .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm suddenly feel flush . my heart rate be elevate , my palm be clammy , my mouth be dry . in addition , i keep involuntarily say hoo .
oh , we know what 's cause that , do n't we ?
it 's no mystery . i obviously have the flu couple with sudden-onset tourette 's syndrome .
do you hear about the accident at the bio lab ?
no . what happen ?
they be inject rat with radioactive isotope and one of the tech get bit .
do he get superpower ?
no , he get five stitch and a tetanus shot .
oh . well , that 's disappoint .
why ?
well , you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab , you kind of want to turn into a superhero .
mouse boy ?
you do n't like mouse boy ? how about , uh , uh , kid vermin ?
first of all , if we have superpower , i would n't be the sidekick . you 'd be the sidekick .
rat-man be nobody 's sidekick .
leonard , settle this . of the two of u , who 's the obvious sidekick ?
yeah , leonard , who ?
_ year after high school , and i 'm still at the nerd table .
be n't you slice that man 's brain a little too thin ?
it 's too thin if i be make a foot-long brain sandwich at quiznos . for examination under a two-photon microscope , it 's fine .
well , you 're the expert . if the correct way to do it be the wrong way , then i yield .
very well . if you die and donate your body to science , i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon .
thank you .
now , if you 'll excuse me , i have to take my temperature .
be you monitoring your circadian rhythm in order to identify your period of maximum mental acuity ? i do that one summer . ah , youth .

i have n't consider that . give me a moment . all right , i 've consider it .
and ?

i may have fail .
i do n't want to go without penny .
oh , great . no superman , no wonder woman ? all we 've get be a skinny flash , an indian aquaman , a nearsighted green lantern , and a teeny , tiny dark knight .
obviously , we 're no longer a justice league . we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costume .
ooh , i call kermit .
i 'm kermit . you 're scooter .
oh , man . scooter suck . he 's the aquaman of the muppet baby .
no , we can still make this work . leonard , you talk to penny .

you get her to have sex with you . obviously , your superpower be brainwashing .
okay , let me see if i understand this . you want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize ?
go away , sheldon .
it 's leonard .
oh . go away , leonard .
come on , let me just talk to you .
it 's open .
hey .
i 'm not go to that party , leonard .
okay , listen . you do n't have to wear the wig . at this party , we 're gon na win first prize just by show up with a girl .
okay , look . we 're not really me and him .
then what be you ?
i do n't know . i only start see zack again so i would n't be alone on new year 's eve . how pathetic be that ?
not a pathetic a dress up like this and go to a comic book store on new year 's eve .
green lantern .
like there 's a difference .
there 's a big difference . arrow . lantern .
whatever . look , if zack and i have just go to a regular club or a party , it would have be fine , but this , with the costume , and you .
what about me ?
nothing . let 's go to the party . how do i look ?
okay , the good news be , we have a wonder woman .
yes .
and the award for best group costume go to justice league of america number three !
seven , six
five , four , three
two , one ! happy new year !
that be a great party . we should dress like this all the time .
be you high ?
you 're be a bully .
check it out . those guy be break into that car .
what should we do ?
nah . hold up .
look , i know our winter thermostat set be _ degree , but i 'm a little warm , so i 'm go to turn it down .
that 's a hanukkah present you 're regret , huh ?
i wo n't say that all senior citizen who ca n't master technology should be publicly flog , but if we make an example of one or two , it might give the others incentive to try harder .
i have a great idea . you know how we 're always have to stop and solve differential equation , like when you 're do fourier analysis , or use the schrodinger equation ?
you know what 's a great app ? the one that make fart noise .
you know , leonard , that 's actually a valid idea . very good .
oh , yay for me . what about you guy ? i ca n't promise anything , but people do make money off stuff like this .
a few extra buck would be nice . i could finally move out of my mother 's house .
where would you go ?
i always dream about building a little place of my own over the garage .
you know , if i make more money , i could take time off from work and give pretty girl submarine ride .
what 's that ? some weird sex thing ?
no . you take pretty girl underwater in your private submarine , and you show them fish . why do everything have to be dirty with you ?
i be think we could work on this at night , and then maybe in a couple of week , we 'll have ourselves an app to sell .
sound like we 're in business .
i think we should take a picture to capture this moment .
yeah .
oh !
be that the best _ cent i ever spent , or what ?
i checked the app store . no one be do handwriting-recognition differential equation solve .
oh , dear lord , shush .
you have so few good idea , leonard . and you 're just go to spill the bean in front of an outsider ?
who , me ?
sheldon , i do n't think penny care about handwriting-recognition base differential
the star at night be big and bright , deep in the heart of texas .
she 's not go to steal our idea .
what idea ?
we 're gon na write an application
the prairie sky be wide and high , deep in the heart
okay , stop , stop !
of texas .
whatever your secret be , i 'm sure it 's boring , so i 'm not interested .
it 's not boring at all . you see , in high order mathematics , there be certain set of equation that
bore .
satisfied ?
hardly . consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario . a young woman alone in the big city . her ridiculous dream of become an actress lie shatter about her .
hey , wait a minute .
well , hang on . let 's see where he 's go .
hey , i
hang on . let 's see where he 's go .
she befriends them , and then lie in wait until they reveal a marketable idea , which she steal and sell to the high bidder .
that be ridiculous .
oh , be it ? well let 's see you come up with an explanation a to why this woman hang out with u all the time .
oh , great . you know what ? i 've already mooch dinner off you guy . i do n't need to listen to this .
there 's your answer , free food .
all right , i 've take the liberty of draft these workflow chart which outline our various duty and the path we will follow a we develop our ground-breaking new app .
a customer service representative with an indian accent will create the impression we 're a vast enterprise that us overseas call centre .
oh . very clever . but still racist .
duly note , steve from wichita .
why be i list a your executive assistant ?
because the word secretary have fall into disrepute . fyi , my mother 's birthday be come up . i 'm go to need you to pick up a present .
okay , we need to stop for a minute .
leonard , please , we can talk during our break . we have one come up at midnight . we 'll need snack .
sheldon , you 're not in charge . it 's my idea . i 'm in charge .
oh , of course you be . look at the organizational chart . you 're clearly list a founder .
well , yes , and you 're list a chief executive officer , chief financial officer and chief operating officer .
you miss chief science officer , chairman of the board , and head of the secret santa committee .
okay . you need to get clear on this right now . i be in charge of this project .
ooh . leonard 's go all alpha nerd on sheldon 's as .
all right . all right , i 'm not go to argue with you . sheldon cooper be nothing if not a team player . dr hofstadter , you have the conn .
thank you . i thought we might start by talk about the user interface .
so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation , but over here , you can press this , and just substitute new value for the coefficient .
good one , bos .
what ?
this diagram . i assume you be opening with a joke . it certainly buoyed up this employee 's esprit de corp .
it 's not a joke . it 's the real design .
in that case , may i offer _ little tweak to make it slightly less embarrass ?
sheldon , i think this will work . let 's just try it my way .
oh , i 'm , i 'm sorry . i assume that you want candid truth-telling from your employee , but i realize now , you want the mindless natter of complacent yes-man .
be you do ?
if you say so , bos .
so right now , this button-press event be just trigger a dummy procedure call
how about this for the app name ? the surprisingly helpful equation-linked differential optimize numerator .
so it spell sheldon ?
do it ? a happy accident .
we 're not do name now . howard ?
all right , fine . if we 're not go to give it a name , can we at least give it a secret code designation ?
no .
well , but hear me out . the atomic bomb be the manhattan project . window _ be originally project chicago . for our app , i would humbly suggest project nodlehs .
another happy accident .
we 're not waste time with name right now .
i see . be that decision open for discussion ?
no .
be the decision to not discus it open for discussion ?
no .
again , right now it 's just a dummy procedure , but eventually , it will drop u into
i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership .
oh sheldon , stop it .
when in the course of human event , it becomes necessary to dissolve the bond that tie three competent scientist together
that 's enough , sheldon .
all right , let 's get right to the vote . show of hand all those oppose to leonard and his reign of tyranny .
okay , that 's it , you 're fire .
really ? why ?
because you 're impossible to work with .
i see . and be that open for discussion ?
oh . good morning , shoemaker . i think you 'll be pleased with what the elf be up to last night .
but i fire you .
oh , i know . i 'm now an independent contractor .
no , you be now nothing . you have no connection to this project whatsoever .
i do n't want it well . i want it my way .
well , that speaks volume , do n't it ? all right , i suppose i 'll go put on my bus pant .
look , i 'm still happy to drive you to work . nothing 's change in that regard . we 're still roommate , we 're still friend .
except you identify me , your best friend , a a gangrenous limb that need to be sever from the organism and toss away . the desperate act of a little man with a big napoleon complex .
good morning , friend howard . friend raj . i see you gentleman be enjoy beverage . perhaps they would taste well out of these .
world 's great astrophysicist ?
do n't thank me . you earn it .
we 're not quit on leonard .
i understand . and your loyalty be admirable . but what if i be to up the ante ?
what be you talk about ?
okay , let 's try this one . spherical hankel function .
hold on . that 's it !
hey , we agree when it be eureka time , we be all gon na say it together .
fine . let 's say it together .
no . the moment have pass .
greeting , gentleman . how go your little project ?
ah , a combination of all your name . very clever . i assume koothranardowitz be take ?
we 're actually scan equation and get good result .
oh , well then , by all mean , carry on . i would n't want to impede your progress .
no . it 's a little tricky . i 'm gon na try have it pick up the library dynam
what be you do ? !
play the theremin .
play it . i 've love the theremin from the first moment i heard the original star trek theme . and it 's be kill me that it just sits in my closet , gathering dust .
sheldon ! we 're work here !
no , that be completely call for . we need quiet .
well , see a your project be to sabotage my project , yes .
do n't beat around the bush , leonard . if you do n't want me here , just say the word , and i 'll leave .
could have beaten around the bush a little .
nobody know the trouble i 've see , nobody know my sorrow-ow-ow-ow .
what you do ? try to contact your home planet ?
i 'm practice my theremin .
oh .
nobody know the trouble i 've see . glory , hallelujah .
something get you down , there , sheldon ?
leonard kick me out of my own apartment . and his app team .
oh , honey , i 'm sorry .
he would n't drive me to work today . i have to wear my bus pant .
be that so ?
yes . and they 're still sticky .
aw .
probably go to have to throw them away .
hey , you do n't need leonard and his app . you can make one with me .
with you ?
seriously , i have a great idea for one .
okay , look , when you see someone wear shoe you like , you just snap a picture of them , and the app go on the internet to find out where you can buy them .
well , you do n't like it ?
i do n't say that . but no , i do n't .
why not ?
oh , penny , where do i begin ? the simple-mindedness of your idea be exceed only by it crass consumerism and banality .
and leonard do n't want to work with you ? imagine that .
i know , it 's baffling . nobody know the trouble i 've see .
sheldon , i 'm gon na make some cocoa . do you want some ?
do you make it with milk or water ?
milk .
real cocoa ?
do you have those little marshmallow ?
well , i suppose it 's appropriate .
what do that mean ?
a disappoint drink for a disappoint day .
i 'm tell you , the lenwoloppali differential equation scanner meet a real need . we 've get a hit .
what do you think we should sell it for ?
well , base on the fact that our potential market be about _ or _ guy , and you want a submarine , i 'd say about a million dollar a pop .
well , what if we put out a lite version for half a million ? you know , get the word of mouth go .
hi . i 'm sorry to bother you guy , but you 've get to come take your sheldon back .
what 's he do in your apartment ?
well , he be mop down in the lobby , so i invite him over , and now i regret it .
look , ca n't you just let him play with you until bedtime ?
we 're not play . this be real work .
we 're go to be hundred-aires .
okay . what if i get him to apologize and promise to behave ?
then i guess we would let him back on the app team , and while we 're do that , you could take an aerial tour of l.a on your fly pig .
really ? leonard want me back ?
oh , yes . he say they be lose without you .
that 's right .
you know what i 'm go to do ? i be go to sit here and just let them stew .
no , no , no . you know , they have suffer enough . everybody 's suffer enough . the thing be , you 're go to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this .
how ?
say you 're sorry .
oh , no . mr mary cooper do n't raise her no liar .
no .
no ?
i be be sarcastic .
oh . good for you . so all you have to do here be say you 're sorry to leonard , but say it sarcastically .
of course . he will hear it a an attempt to mend fence , a oppose to the wither condemnation you and i will know it to be .
yeah . yeah , that be my plan . all right . come on . let 's go .
oh , by the way , thank you for the delicious cocoa .
oh , you 're welcome .
okay , now that you 're back on the team , let 's get you caught up .
before you begin , let me say again how deeply sorry i be for my earlier behaviour and how much i respect and admire your leadership .
thank you . so a you can see , not only can you store your favourite equation , but you can forward them to your friend or post them on facebook right from the app .
well , i must say , i be impressed .
thanks .
you all have clearly put in a lot of hard work .
we have .
a a result , you have take the most important step on the road to success , learn what not to do . now , let 's start fresh . howard , we 're go to need some tea .
okay , these be uggs . these be crocs . these be knockoff manolo blahniks .
bore .
look , you say it yourself , we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy .
nobody know the trouble i 've see , nobody know my sorrow
penny , a moment ? do you have plan this weekend ?
oh , gee , amy , i 'm sorry , i 'm actually pretty busy this weekend .
that 's too bad . i be hop you could be my plus-one at the institute of interdisciplinary study ' symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interaction .
the what ?
it 's an annual science conference . we 've all be invite to speak .
oh . oh , okay , well , you know , like i say , i have plan , so .
shame . since you 're my best friend , i thought it would be a good bonding opportunity .
i 'm your best friend ?
oh , do n't feel bad . i never read leonard 's , and i use to sleep with him .
do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in big sur ?

in order to take a vacation , one first have to work .
you know , for a smart guy , you really seem to have a hard time grasp the concept , do n't piss off the people who handle the thing you eat .
that do seem to be a valid principle .
i trust penny will adhere to the official california restaurant worker ' solemn oath of ethic and cleanliness . ”
i do n't believe there 's any such thing .
nobody care about your kegel exercise .
all right . we have seven people , and two car . in the lead car , driven by leonard , will be myself , amy farrah fowler and penny .
yes ! he have you in the other car , but i get you upgraded .

although road trip god do have a certain ring to it .
i do n't understand why you people just let him bully you like this . someone should stand up to him . what 's he go to do ?
i ca n't believe you let him kick me out of the car .

yeah , let 's go with that .
still nothing . remind me to try again in an hour .
will do .
so , girl talk ?
um , sure . what do you , what do you get in mind ?
do you subscribe to the freudian theory of penis envy ?
um , i never really thought about it . why ?
sometimes i think it might be nice to have one .
not for sex , for convenience . you ca n't deny that , by comparison , our internal plumbing be extremely high maintenance .
again , i 've never give it much thought .
we have time now . think about it .
can i stay here tonight ?
howard 's a complete and total as .
thanks . i 'll sleep on the floor .

sleep .
right . so we 'll just call the middle here the neutral zone .
the what ?
star trek . you know , the neutral zone between the federation and the romulan empire .
oh , okay . just like old time .
of course , sometimes the federation and the romulans would enter the neutral zone to negotiate a temporary truce .
get it , get it . we can do all kind of stuff from the waist up , you know ?
go to sleep .
good night .
please tell me you 're not have coitus .
we be not have coitus .

hey , leonard , sheldon kick me out of the room , give me your key .
i think mr wolowitz need to keep in mind that the past be the past . but he should know that i be the kind of girl who could get all the giant missile she want .
be we talk about woman want penis ? because i 'd like to weigh in .
dr koothrappali , would you care to join the conversation ?
certainly . i 'd like to raise two point . number one , i think they be talk about penis . and number two , these mimosa be kick my little brown as .
i 'd like to kick your little brown as .
what do i do ?
oh , i do n't know . maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy get back together with his girlfriend , you should consider do something other than crawl into the adjoin bed .
i do . you say no bridget jones .
we be n't get back together ! it be a one-time thing !
excuse me . we 're not take comment or question from the audience just yet .
oh , shut up , sheldon !
hi , bestie .
yeah , hi .
all right , why do n't we see if we can bring this back to topic .
let me ask you something , bernie .
i guess not .
oh , come on , howard , be realistic .
what , i 'm not hot enough for angelina jolie ?
i 'd like to weigh in here . no .
um , penny , that 's glenn . glenn , that 's penny .
no !
red leader to red five . red leader to red five . anybody up for a little game ? i spy with my little eye , a nonferrous metal .
must be out of range .
leonard , can i ask you a question ?
sure .
be you bother by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what be probably the most beautiful man i 've ever see in my life ?
no . why do you ask ?
because we 're go _ mile per hour .
i found another tweet from a student at sheldon 's lecture . dr cooper have take a relatively boring subject and manage to make it completely insufferable . plus , he look like a giant insect .
look . listen to this one . do einstein 's theory explain why time fly when you 're have fun , but when you 're listen to dr cooper , it fall out of the sky , dead ?
ooh , somebody take picture and uploaded them to their flickr account .
wow . how do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time ?
apparently , if you 're sheldon , all you need to do be turn your back .
hey , leonard , be your wi-fi down ? i ca n't get on .
oh , sheldon change the password . it 's now penny be a freeloader . no space .
thanks . what be you guy do ?
sheldon give a lecture at the university tonight . we 're reading the review .
oh . how 'd he do ?
well , picture the hindenburg meet chernobyl meet three mile island meet tron _ .
that bad , huh ?
read this woman 's tweet .
listen to dr cooper have make me want to start cut myself again
yeah .
good even , leonard , howard , raj , freeloader .
so , how 'd the lecture go ?
in a word , triumphant .
really ? triumphant ?
oh , yes , you should have see those young people . thirsty for knowledge , drinking in my wisdom . i may have change a few life today .
oh , please let me tell him .
i do n't know , i kind of promise howard .
tell me what ?
actually , we should all share the moment . raj , if you would .
oh , uh , from the context , we think it mean kill me now .
well , i suppose everyone 's entitle to their own opinion . i think i 'll turn in . i do n't want to teach those poopy head , anyway .
fyi , i think that 's what darth vader say just before he start building the death star .
sheldon still mop ?
yeah , it 's weird . even though he do n't want to give the lecture in the first place , be reject by those student really hit him hard .
be you guy do okay ?
well , that should n't be too hard . he 's such a cutie .
labradoodle ?
do n't you listen to them . you 've get plenty of sex appeal .
yeah . you 're a hottie .
well , thanks , bernadette . and just for the record , labradoodles be hypo-allergenic , which be a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander .
so , what do you think ?
it 's a charm illusion , but it do not cheer me up .
not even when i do this ?
no .
do you realize that teach be the first thing i 've fail at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in march of _ ?
if this humiliate experience be really trouble you , there be thing we could do about it .
for instance ?
well , the first thing that come to mind be isolate the part of your brain where the memory be store and destroy it with a laser .
hmm , no . one slip of the hand , and suddenly i 'm sit in the engineering department , building doodad with wolowitz .
be n't that their burden ? i 'm the one with something interest to say .
fair enough , but in it essence , teach be a performance art . in the classroom paradigm , the teacher have the responsibility to communicate , a well a entertain and engage .
perhaps you should consider take act lesson .
act lesson . interest . it might help if i could act a though i care about my student and whether or not they learn .
penny . penny . penny .
what ?
you 're an actress , correct ?
i 'm not an actress . i 'm an actress .
all right . you 're an actress . i need you to teach me .
you want an act lesson ?
perhaps two . i 'd like to master the craft .
okay , where be this come from ?
it have be suggest to me that act technique could improve my lecture , at which , if certain tweet and blog be to be believe , i suck the big one .
yeah , i saw those . they be funny . i print a few out and put 'em on my fridge .
okay , just to be clear . you be ask me for help because i know something that the brilliant dr sheldon cooper do n't .
i suppose that 's one way to look at it .
i think it 's the only way to look at it .
probably . i 'm just enjoy the foreplay . do this mean you be do mock my act career ?
oh , i 'm sorry , i thought make the transition from actor to act teacher be the signal that one 's career have reach the end of the road .
forget it .
i 'll pay you _ dollar .

penny , my body and i have a relationship that work best when we maintain a cool , wary distance from each other .
all right , let 's just say we 've warm up .
you 're the teacher .
okay . one of the thing that might help you in connect with your student be be a little more spontaneous . so why do n't we try some improvisation ?
why not ? it seem like you 're improvise your entire curriculum .
this be all about listen and respond .
i 'm go to create a character and a situation , and you just jump in when you feel it .
all right .

pick out the hottest guy in the room , take him home , do unspeakable thing to him , then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth mark on his heinie ?
more or less .

forgive my language , but poppycock .
what if he 's right ? and by not participate in gossip , society break down into small feral band of tattooed motorcycle rider fight to the death over the last few can of tuna fish ?
fine . in the parlance of the urban music scene , what 's the _ ?
bernadette be think about break up with howard .

yes , in part .
excuse me ?
yeah , but not your book . something they might enjoy . i kid , of course . big fan .

fine , do n't tell me .
all right , get this . bernadette be think about break up with howard .

you 'll need to explain the game to me .
well , regardless , i 've get four ticket , and i be think we can bring bernadette and howard . she 's really interest , and i bet i can get use to him .
why not ?
oh , too bad . although i do know one person for whom that 's good news .
my brother . he 's get a big crush on bernadette .
mmm . i found poem he write about her . very disturb . oh , bernadette , please play my clarinet .
yes . and for year , everyone in my family be convince that he be the clarinet enthusiast . hmm . what 's that piece of tape ?
oh , that one do n't apply to you . you sit .
hey !
hey ! how 's it go ?
not too bad . do you hear about howard and bernadette ?
‘ course i heard about it . how do you hear about it ?
i heard about it from sheldon . he get it from amy .
oh , damn it . i told amy that in the strictest confidence . boy , some people be such blabbermouth . well , whatever , i 'm sure bernadette can do well .
do you think a sexually ambivalent indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issue be well than a hundred-pound jewish guy who life with his mom ?
you be kid . raj like bernadette ?
i do n't say raj . who say raj ?
okay , give . how do you know ? do he tell you ?
no .
well , then who ?
i ca n't say .
priya told you . what a little gossip . you know , not an attractive quality in a woman , leonard . not judging , just my opinion .
well , the point be , if this get out , it would destroy howard and raj 's friendship .
you do n't have to worry . unlike amy and priya , i know how to keep a secret .
you 're the one who told amy in the first place .
in confidence !
why ? be rajesh not make you feel comfortable ? rajesh , why be n't you make your sister comfortable ?
now , hold on . if she be date an american , that 's not a bad way to go . he 's jewish . those chap be very successful , and they do n't drink a lot .
for now .
i 'll tell you later .
thank you , daddy .
well you should have kept your mouth shut .
fair enough . now , what 's up with clarinet ? bernadette !
be you listen to this guy ?
hmm ? oh , i 'm sorry . i be somewhere else .
now i 'm think about jell-o .
so what 's up ?
it 's a bernadette thing .
oh , no . i hope everything 's okay .
whatever it be , we 're here for you . you can tell u anything .
yeah . good or devastate .
i 'm gon na ask her to marry me .
marry you ?
what ?
yeah . i just need to figure out the right time to pop the question .
oh , i 'd wait .
man , he 's go to be blindside .
i know . it 'll be awful .
why be you smile ?
yeah , raj , why ?
uh , a smile mean something different in my country . you know , tear of joy , smile of sadness . india 's a goofy place .
oh , i 'm back to train . woo-woo .
do i tell you our lab get a grant to study addiction ?
no .
fascinate work . i recently train a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarette .
yes . he look much cooler than the non-smoking monkey . although it 's not much of a contest . the other monkey just sit around and masturbate .
by all mean .
howard have announce his intention to propose marriage to bernadette .
i do n't understand . the original piece of gossip indicate an impend breakup .
i know . the group consensus be that his proposal will be met with an humiliate , soul-crushing rejection . everyone be set a-twitter . although oddly , no one tweet .
it 's not surprising that the story have capture the attention of our little circle of friend . be you familiar with meme theory ?
i 'm familiar with everything , but go on .
meme theory suggests that item of gossip be like living thing that seek to reproduce use human a their host .
i 'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology . at johnson elementary school , the phrase shelly cooper 's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire .
i should think so . that 's gold .
your meme hypothesis do intrigue me . how might we examine this more closely ?
do you have any ethical qualm regard human experimentation ?
it 's one of the few form of interaction with people that i do n't find repellent .
and a second non-tantalizing piece to use a a control .
then we 'll track it progress through our social group and interpret the result through the compete academic prism of memetic theory , algebraic gossip and epidemiology .
look at you , get me to engage in the social science . you 're a vixen , amy farrah fowler .
yeah .
me , too . good time .
oh , thanks .
this be nice .
what the hell be you do ? howard be your best friend , and that be his girlfriend . you should be ashamed of yourself .
i be when i come in , but it 's amaze what liquor do to guilt . besides what you might not know be , bernadette be planning on break up with howard .
well , i know that . how do you know that ?
my sister told me .
oh , that gossipy bitch ! no offense .
what can i do ? i ca n't stop think about her .
all right , try think about this . sheldon and amy have sex .
shut your as !
yeah , it 's true . amy told me .
i-i guess they just figure it out at some point .
wow . i ca n't believe old smelly pooper finally get laid .
hey .
hey .
hope you 're hungry .
interest . a friendly sentiment in this country , cruel taunt in the sudan . it 's a lesson in context .
will amy be join u for dinner ?
yes , i believe so .
good , good . everything okay between you two ?
yes . why do you ask ?
no reason . i be just talk to raj , and he mention what a lovely glow she have these day .
do he mean a if she 'd be out in the sun , tend an herb garden without wear a hat or sunblock ?
no . that 's not what he meant .
well , we may never know . a my mother would say , the asian be an inscrutable folk . now , if you 'll excuse me , i have work to do .
yeah , you do . you dog , you .
do you get that ?
every word . our false gossip meme appear to have reach node lambda .
this be move faster than we thought .
agree . it appear the rate of gossip transmission be proportional to the number of node square .
i must say , amy , pretend to have intercourse with you be give me a great deal of satisfaction .
slow down , sheldon . i 'm not quite there yet .
sure .
bernadette just ask about my sexual encounter with you . the meme have reach full penetration .
no . happy accident .
this be remarkable . take less than _ hour .
i should let you know that she ask for detail about our dalliance .
interest . so it go beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow , a it be .
pun intend ?
i 'm sorry . what pun ?
not important . i described your lovemaking a aloof , but effective .
i wish you have n't do that . that 's go to make me a chick magnet , and i 'm so busy a it be .
hey , everybody , i get something i want to ask bernadette , and i ca n't think of a well time than when i 'm with all my friend .
oh , hold on , howard . there 's lot of well time .
leonard , please . the man be talk . let him get it out , and let the chip fall where they may .
oh , god . what 's happen ?
yes .
yes , i will marry you .
you will ?
i will . i will !
oh , i love you , too .
oh , it 's so excite .
i wonder what change her mind .
perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renew her faith in love .
a good an explanation a any .
that 's great .
oh , hey , amy . bernadette just texted me . howard propose ?
yes , not important . just stop by to let you know i 'm get orthotics . also , i 'm carry sheldon 's baby . mum 's the word .
you 're pregnant ?
wow . be there anything on there about orthotics ?
leonard , be you in the shower ?

moot . render unimportant by recent event .
i ca n't hear you , i 'm in the shower .
i have to skip the chitchat . emergency .
what kind of emergency ?
mathematical . 32-ounce banana smoothie , 16-ounce bladder .
you might not want to do that .
i assure you i do .
sheldon , i 'm not alone in here .
we be in here first , you ca n't be in here .
accord to the roommate agreement , paragraph nine , subsection b , the right to bathroom privacy be suspend in the event of force majeure . and believe me , i be experience a very majeure force .
oh , leonard , let the man pee .
penny ? penny ? penny ?
hang on . no , my client do not waive reading of the charge .
can i see the roommate agreement ?
all right , base on a cursory reading , it do n't look like you have much of a case , sheldon .
oh , i 'm afraid not . section seven here , on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situation , be not specific a to what constitutes an emergency .
be it ? if leonard forgot to trim his nose hair , could he barge in while you be shower ?
there 's no buts , sheldon , that 's how the law work .
supercede !
this be n't over .
no offence , but shower sex with you be now the second best thing that 's happen today .
seriously ?
i wish to discus your theory of black hole . meet me at the randy 's donut by the airport at _ a.m .
what be that you 're eat ? tonight be pizza night .
accord to what i see here , thursday night be franconi 's pizza night .
yes , and when franconi 's go out of business , we switch to graziano 's .
opa !

whee-ee-ee !
you smell like baby powder .
it 's talc . but a that 's a primary ingredient of baby powder , i understand your confusion .
oh , i 'm not confuse at all . you 're like a sexy toddler .
i do . amy and sheldon sit in a tree . k-i-s-s-s-s-i-n-g .
not if they 're do it for a long time .
that do n't count . be n't you even a little curious ?
yeah , you 're a scientist , where be the curiosity ?
i 'm available for experimentation .
thank you . not necessary . we know everything there be to know about kiss . it require _ facial muscle and _ postural muscle .
oh , blah , blah , blah . give me some sugar , bestie .
i 'm certainly glad no one say they be curious about aztec human sacrifice .
oh , i totally want to see sheldon dance . i bet he look like a spider on a hot plate .
no , thank you , but for the record , i 'm an excellent dancer . proficient in the rumba , waltz and cha-cha .
really ?
do you take dance lesson ?
oh , we be so take you dance .
well , what do your cotillion training say be expect of a gentleman when three lady ask him to escort them to a dance soiree ?

what 's _ time _ ?
my burp taste like cranberry juice .
and there 's your answer .
if you 're refer to the beverage , you know i do n't drink . if you 're refer to the hat you don while wear a nightshirt and hold a candle , i have one .
i have yoo-hoo .
it 's hard to say no to yoo-hoo . the name literally beckons .
make yourself comfortable .
oh , that 's just ricky .
you own a smoking monkey ?
do n't be silly . he 's one of the animal in my department 's nicotine addiction study .
what 's he do here ?
i 'm give him emphysema . the least i can do be let him hang out and watch cable .
remarkable . be n't you worried about secondhand smoke ?
a little . the real danger be him biting my face off while i 'm sleep .
be he deliberately blowing smoke at me ?
yeah . he 's kind of an as .
thank you . may i share something with you that 's trouble me ?
of course . what 's rattle around that big bulbous brain of yours ?
priya have essentially nullified my roommate agreement with leonard , make life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me .
and you want me to kill her ? do .
no , of course not .
i train ricky how to smoke . i can train him to shoot a poison dart . no jury would convict u 'cause people love monkey .
i understand the alcohol have stir up whatever it be that make girl go wild , but i really need to talk to smart amy now .
excuse me . have you consider that your intelligence might be the very thing cause your dilemma ?
what do you think ricky over here would do if an interloper encroach on his territory ?
well , when challenged , monkey generally assert their dominance through chase , assault and a stylize penile display . that 's a little outside my comfort zone .
you 're be too literal . my point be , he would not meekly surrender to the rule , and neither should you .
be you suggest i play dirty ?
yes , dirty . dirty , dirty , dirty . which brings me to our next order of business .
fascinate .
i hope you do n't take what i 'm about to do a a comment on what we just do .

this be ridiculous . you 're just make stuff up .
be he always like this when he loses ?
oh , yes . you should 've be here for the great jenga tantrum of _ .
you bumped the table and you know it .
perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suit to his ability . we 'll close our eye and count to ten while you hide .
i 'm go to my room .
very good , leonard . but next time , do n't tell u where you 're hiding .
do you guy see the paper in the american physic journal on supersolids ? it 's pretty interest . this guy 's work from a hypothesis where
spoiler alert ! spoiler alert .

ah , ah .
hey , look , it 's shamy .
shamy ?
a juvenile amalgamation of our name . sheldon and amy , shamy .
oh . i do n't like that . do n't do that .
all righty . what 's new ?
well , just recently , i learn that you refer to u a shamy , and i do n't like that .
i get it . but what i be go for be , you know , how 's your life ?
like everybody else 's . subject to entropy , decay and eventual death . thank you for ask . why be she not take our order ?
really ? i assume an establishment call the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently .
it 's how they lure you in . i believe it 's call bait and switch .
okay , i 'm just gon na walk away , 'cause i do n't want to be here .
so , this be nice . first time we 've all gotten together to eat .
you 're right , he 's a festival of humdrum chitchat .
okay , that 's all i get . howard , you 're up .
um , tell u about your work , amy .
i doubt you 'd understand . sheldon tell me you only have a master 's degree .
raj , do you have any question for amy ?
she 's not my girlfriend . she 's a girl and she 's my friend , but there 's no touch or unsanitary exchange of saliva .
get it .
although , for the record , on one occasion , she lick her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth . it 's an action we both regret to this day .
uh-huh . anyway , i 'm not sure she 's the best fit for our little , how should we call it , rebel alliance .
oh , i never identify with the rebel alliance . despite their tendency to build death star , i 've always be more of an empire man .
yeah , not my point .
i know what your point be . you 're intimidate by amy 's intellect . to that i say , buck up .
okay , let me just get right to it . amy be judgmental , sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious .
so we already have you for all that .
be you suggest i terminate my relationship with amy ?
yes . and i 'd thank you to do the same .
ah . nothing make beer taste well than cool clear rocky mountain spring water . where be the rocky mountain , anyway ?
philadelphia .
really ? i thought they be out west someplace .
think about it , raj . where do the movie rocky take place ?
so this be the plan ? from now on , we 're just gon na hide out in here to avoid the shamy ?
i 'm very comfortable here . penny , dear , why do n't you shoot another silver bullet my way ?
get one yourself .
ooh , somebody 's be take bitchy pill .
god , he 's an as when he drink .
oh , he 's an as when he do n't . you just do n't hear it .
i think we need to start entertain the possibility that the shamy could go on for year .
well , if that 's the case , penny will have to get satellite tv and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place .
i thought you be go to talk to sheldon .
i do .
well , what 'd he say ?
well , he point out that he kinda , sorta have to put up with you .
kinda , sorta have to ?
i do n't agree with him .
well , you defend me , right ?
what ?
gim me .
no .
trust me .
no !
i do this for my mom all the time . see ? with the grain .
and someday , when you have varicose vein , i 'll show you how to massage them .
i be homesick .
the highlight of the even be when you show u your bollywood break dance skill .
that 's very offensive .
yeah , we all thought so .
oh , no .
what ?
john and yoko .
more like yoko and yoko .
greeting .
hey .
i brought amy here to show her some of the work i 'm do .
it 's very impressive , for theoretical work .
i 'm sorry , be i be too subtle ? i meant compare to the real-world application of neurobiology , theoretical physic be , what 's the word i 'm look for ? hmm , cute .
oooh !
be you suggest the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarke-maxwell or dirac ?
i 'm state it outright . babinski eats dirac for breakfast and defecates clarke-maxwell .
i 'm sorry , i'm-i 'm still try to work on the defecate clark maxwell , so
excuse me , but a grand unified theory , insofar a it explains everything , will ipso facto explain neurobiology .
yes , but if i 'm successful , i will be able to map and reproduce your thought process in derive a grand unified theory , and therefore , subsume your conclusion under my paradigm .
that 's the rankest psychologism , and be conclusively reveal a hogwash by gottlob frege in the 1890s !
we appear to have reach an impasse .
i agree . i move our relationship terminate immediately .
second .
no , uh-uh .
the motion carry . good day , amy farrah fowler .
good day , sheldon cooper .
woman , huh ? ca n't live with them , ca n't successfully refute their hypothesis .
amen to that .
hey , sheldon .
hello .
i hear you broke up with amy .

howard , a girl do n't go out with a man like you , with your look , your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pant if she 's not expect him to eventually make the move .

well , we 'll just see how your noxious gas fare against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candle .
do n't you say you 're make hydrogen sulphide gas ?
yes .
this be not over .
all i 'm say be , if they take all the money they spent try to make a decent hulk movie , they could probably just make an actual hulk .
that be apt and amuse . i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler . she 'll appreciate the witticism .
it 'll also help improve her initial impression of you .
so what 's go on with you two ?
well , the status be a it always be . she 's a girl . she 's a friend . she be not my , please forgive me for do this , girlfriend .
right , right . so you 're still just texting and email ? you do n't feel any need to hang out with her , you know , be in the same room ?
leonard , you be my best friend . i 've know you for seven year , and i can barely tolerate sit on the couch with you . imagine my attitude regard prolong physical proximity to amy farrah fowler .
get it .
i sense judgment on your part .
no , no . maybe a little .
jealousy ? what do i have to be jealous of ?
i 'm not jealous .
hu-u-urgh ! leonard not jealous .
you know , it just occur to me , if there be an infinite number of parallel universe , in one of them , there 's probably a sheldon who do n't believe parallel universe exist .
probably . what 's your point ?
no point . it 's just one of the thing that make one of the me chuckle . what make you chuckle , leonard ?
hmm , recently ? not much .
be it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman , and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity ?
that sound lovely .
it be if you like bridge . do you like bridge , leonard ?
sheldon , i 'm just not date someone right now . i do n't need to go to a senior centre .
meemaw resist at first , but now she love it .
fine . if i do n't meet someone soon , you can put me in a home .
it 's not a home . it 's a senior centre . we 'd never put meemaw in a home !
hey , guy .
hey .
hey .
all right , i 'll bow to social pressure . hey !
when i call him , his phone play brown eyed girl . which , now that i think about it , be not so good .
you realize he 's just rub our nose in the fact that he have a girlfriend , and we do n't .
you mean , you do n't .
you have a girlfriend ? how could you have a girlfriend ? you ca n't even speak to woman .
two word , deaf chick . it do n't matter if i ca n't talk , because she ca n't hear me .
what ?
that 's what she say .
great . you have a girlfriend , howard 's get a girlfriend , sheldon 's get a girl
…who 's a friend .
thank you .
oh , yeah . yeah . i met her at comic-con , the one place in the world where say i own a comic bookstore be an actual pickup line .
not really . she 's horrible . when she want to have sex , she put on her plus-size wonder woman costume and shout who want to take a ride in my invisible plane ?
no , no , i ca n't .
dude , why do n't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with wolowitz ?
because i do n't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriend . i 'm perfectly capable of find a girl on my own .
oh , leonard , you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walk into a woman 's correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convict to go free .
you 're say i could n't get laid in a woman 's prison with a handful of pardon .
be you go to let me tell the story or not ?
leonard ? be you sleep ?
no .
be you ill ?
no .
be you still depressed because you 're alone , and no one love you ?
i do n't know . maybe .
i want you to know that i 'm genuinely concerned about your well-being .
thank you .
may i offer an observation ?
since we get home from the comic bookstore .
that be two hour ago .
a per your suggestion , we 're hang out . quite frankly , i do n't see what all the hoopla 's about . go on , amy .
from a neurobiological standpoint , leonard , you may be alone because your psychological state be cause an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation .
do you know that , leonard ?
no .
i do .
i understand that some people find mate in social gathering place such a bar or tavern . have you try a bar or tavern ?
right .
that 's not true of all bar . juice bar , for example .
oh ! good point , amy . yeah , building on your premise , leonard could frequent sushi bar , salad bar , oyster bar , the apple genius bar , what be you do ?
keep go . i 'm listen .
he do it all the time . he 's a cornucopia of social awkwardness .
let 's make that our word of the day .
agree . and we 'll use mellifluous tomorrow .
well , i have to void my bladder . it be nice spending this time with you .
wait . i have a request .

uh-huh .
you ca n't say that anymore .
wait . what ?
look , she obviously want to take your relationship to the next level .
me ? well , how be i suppose to fix it ?
simple ! you want a girlfriend , amy want to be someone 's girlfriend . take her off my hand . i give you my blessing .
that be insane .
you 're right . it would never work . amy find you tedious .
wait ! what be i suppose to do ?
well , have you consider tell her how you feel ?
leonard , i 'm a physicist , not a hippie .
all right , well , let me see if i can explain your situation use physic . what would you be if you be attach to another object by an inclined plane wrap helically around an axis ?
howard , get the door !
you know i 'm do a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy ! i 'm like an upside-down volcano here .
oh , hey . i hope you do n't hear that .
what 's with the t-shirt ? you work at the apple store now ?
no , it 's just something i threw on .
i know all your shirt . that 's not one of them . you be pretend to work at the genius bar to pick up woman , be n't you ?
yeah . turn out , they guard the ipod , but they do n't guard the shirt .
just fyi , do n't try to go back with a fake moustache . i mean , they may not really be genius , but they see right through that .
i want to invoke the girlfriend pact , howard .
you that desperate ?
holy moses , how much liquid can be in one tukus ?
yeah , i know what you mean .
well , i 'm off to meet bernadette 's friend . how do i look ?
a if one of the plant from invasion of the body snatcher duplicate you in every way , only with an absurd amount of hair gel .
what be you work on ?
i 'm remove my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler ca n't find me and compel me to meet her mother .
ah , you 're go off the grid .
exactly .
the old unabomber approach . kudos .
thank you . i 've also sent amy a relationship termination notice and change my cell phone number and e-mail address .
what if she just come over ?
she 'll get lose . we no longer live at _ los roble . we now live at _ los roble .
you change the address on the building ? what about mail ?
oh , no worry , i explain my predicament to our letter carrier . he be sympathetic . his exact word be , get your back , jack . bitch be crazy .
who be it ?
amy farrah fowler .
darn ! she found me !
she 's be here before .
the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan . now , get my back , jack .
what do you want to do ?
tell her i 'm not here .
okay , where be you ?
i do n't know . you 'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence , keep in mind that the key to a good lie lie in the detail .
hi , amy . sheldon 's not here .
all right .
way to go on the detail .
joy , this be leonard . leonard , this be joy .
hi . you do n't look like a genius . go ahead , say something smart .
aah ! time 's up . just kid . first thing you need to know about me , i 'm hilarious .

number _ !
this lobster 's good on the way down and the way up .
hey , this be a date , right ?
_ !
fair warn , i have the asparagus . my pee be gon na stink up the place .
i think she like you .
ez aquarii b , ez aquarii c , excuse me , madam .
rat !
i believe a misunderstand may have occur when i ask you to meet my mother .
no misunderstand . i 've learn what that request actually mean , and i do n't want to be join to another object by an inclined plane wrap helically around an axis .
in what way be you screw ? all i want to do be present you a my boyfriend to my mother so she 'll be satisfied that i 'm in a relationship .
so we 'd be perpetrate a ruse ?
and you have n't fall hopelessly in love with me ?
do n't be absurd . i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that add no value to human relationship .
amy farrah fowler , that 's the most pragmatic thing anyone have ever say to me .
i trust this clarification allows u to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status .
of course . would you like to join me for chinese food ?
my apology . good night , amy .
good night , sheldon .

you 're far too short to be darth vader . at best you might be a turncoat ewok .
my point be , priya 's go . and it would be much well if no-one else found out about this .
you mean , you want me to keep a secret .
yes .
you know i ca n't keep a secret .
why do you get to be batman ?
because , well , batman have the secret .
well alfred have secret too .

kind of busy here , sheldon .
i know , that 's why i shorten it .
i come to go over your alibi for last night .
oh , i 'm so sure i 'm go to regret this , but , who be i with ?
the fun love , and morally loose , miss maggie mcgeary .
oh , god .
you met her at pasadena 's most popular irish water hole , lucky baldwin 's , where maggie spends her night tend bar , with a head full of curl and a heart full of dream .
leonard , call me if you 're interested in coitus . sincerely , maggie mcgeary .
and if anyone be to actually call that number they will hear this .
top of the morning to you . you 've reach maggie mcgeary . leave a message after the wee little beep .
it 's pretty convincing , huh ? and it be n't even a real person . and here be the clincher . a lock of maggie 's flame auburn hair .
where do you get that ?
from an orang-u-tan in the primate lab .
an orang-u-tan ?
hey .
hey , leonard , will you please tell howard my sister 's never be attract to him .
c'mon raj , how be i suppose to know who she 's attract to . or be attract to . or who she might be attract to . in the future .
hey , so what do you guy think of the new episode of caprica last night ?
do n't see it ? what be you do ?
uh , i be out .
on caprica night ?
yeah , i , uh , go for a drink .
really , you , and where , where do you go ?
to , uh , lucky baldwin 's .
oh , i 've heard of that place , be n't that pasadena 's favourite irish water hole .
yes .
do you meet anyone interest there , perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid ?
a a matter of fact i i i can't i can't i ca n't do it .
sure you can , you 're do fine , it 's very believable .
look , i 'm sorry raj , but the truth be i be with priya last night .
do n't listen to him , he 's still light head from all the irish whiskey and pickle egg in his system .
i believe they engage in coitus but , more importantly , if leonard have not abandon his story , would you have found it plausible ?
what ? you slept with my sister ?
yeah .
how could you ? we have a pact !
excuse me , i think how could you she 's my sister take precedence over a five year old pinky swear !
may i point out , in a parallel universe , your friend be say maggie mcgeary , she sound lovely .
look , i admit it , i may have cross a line here , but come on , raj , your sister be a grown woman . to her , i 'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate .
i i do n't believe it , this be a terrible betrayal of my trust .
no , no , no , would it help if i told you that i offer her my heart and she kind of stomp on it .
how hard do she stomp ?
very hard .
okay , i 'm good .
yeah , well , raj , i just want to say that i 'd never betray your trust . unlike leonard , i respect you .
really ?
mmm .
be it out of respect that you do n't tell raj about the time you drop his iphone in a urinal ?
dude ! i put that thing on my face !
i think a more amuse violation of raj 's trust be when howard convince him that foreigner give present to american on thanksgiving .
hey , i do n't see you give back your snoopy snowcone maker .
that be all a lie ? this year 's gift be already wrap !
and a long a we 're talk about betraying our friend , how about the month sheldon spent grind up insect and mix them into leonard 's food .
well , excuse me . that be not a betrayal , that be an experiment to determine at what concentration food start taste mothy .
you put moth in my food ?
for science .
i ca n't believe you kiss my sister with moth mouth .
well , uh , i ca n't believe you use sheldon 's toothbrush .
you use my toothbrush ?
thankyou , and i 'm sorry about your phone . and thanksgiving . and while we 're at it , you do n't have to wash our clothes on the fourth of july .
a long a we 're apologise , sheldon , i , i 'm sorry i use your toothbrush .

nobody care . do you know how long it 's be since i get through airport security without be give a colonoscopy ?

penny kiss me be not insane . she use to kiss me all the time .
einstein define insanity a do the same thing over and over again and expect different result . by that standard , penny be cuckoo for cocoa puff .
i 'm just say , it felt like it may have meant something .
ah , this take me back . leonard obsess about penny . i mean , do n't get me wrong , i love your new stuff , but once in a while it 's nice to hear the hit .
ooh , ooh ! do our baby will be smart and beautiful . that one always make me laugh .

give me a minute . i 'm gon na go wash up .
well , that 's odd . we both wash up when we come in . it 's probably a euphemism for urination .
not much . although , i can be fault for be overly fond of koala bear . i do n't know what it be , when they smart munch on eucalyptus , i just melt inside .
honey , she 's upset . you 're her boyfriend . you have to at least try to be excite by the thing she 's excite by .
what if they simply do n't excite me ?
well , just smile and think about koala .
oh , you have a lot of magic stuff .
do it work ?
have she try on the vest yet ?
i hope it fit , she have a tricky figure ! she 's short and stack , like me !

yes .
how come you 're not do a mission ? you 're just wander around .

sometimes with woman you want to listen to what upset them and then show them that you can grow and change .
nut to that . what else you get ?

not him .
i told you i 'm not good with kid .
i 'm sorry . i know it make me sound like a bad person , but i just do n't like child .

yeah , she do n't like them . and from what i saw , the feel be mutual .
you know , there 's no guarantee even if you have kid that you 're go to like them .
wow , that 's rough . where 'd you get that ?
it 's right off the dust jacket of my mom 's last book .
maybe me and bernadette be n't right for each other .

no , i just need those beaker wash . hippity-hop , quick like a bunny .
what ? excuse me , you have dr sheldon cooper in your lab . you 're gon na make him do the dish ? that 's like ask the incredible hulk to open a pickle jar .
sheldon , you 've never work in a lab like this before . you have no experience in the field of biology .
i have plenty of experience in biology . i bought a tamagotchi in _ . and it 's still alive . let 's do this .
where 's howard ?
bernadette want to get a pre-nup .
hmm . i 'm gon na give you the same advice i yell at the tv when the bachelor 's hand out rose . follow your heart .
hey , howard , i need to tell you something .
i know , it 's not on my wedding diet . i do n't care .
uh , listen , i heard that bernadette 's think about ask you for a pre-nup .
a pre-nup ? wow .
what be you gon na do ?
i do n't know .
you know what , it 's not a big deal . she make more money than me . she want to protect her financial interest . it 's completely reasonable .

yeah , actually , it 's good for both of u . i have asset to protect , too .
mr roper 's dead ? you ca n't just spring that on a guy .
here you go . this be now the only lab with glassware wash by a man with two doctorate and a restrain order sign by carl sagan .
soap spot . wash 'em again .

there be something wrong with that detergent . that be way too bubbly .
i 'm sure it be .
yeah , good for you . now , start counting .

really ? be that what you think ?
yes , that 's what i think . and i 'm super smart , so it 's probably true .
hey , i 've be training in the field of neurobiology for _ year . you 've be here for three hour , and you 've spent one of them in the bathroom .
i 'm sorry . it take me a while to get thing go on an unfamiliar toilet .
sheldon , i 've give you the simplest thing to do , and you have n't do one of them right .
maybe that 's because i 'm not be challenged . it 's the same reason einstein fail math .
maybe the math be too bubbly for him .
you think you 're do science by cut up that brain ? they could do the same thing at any quiznos . and they 'd offer to toast it for me , too .
oh , be we nervous , dr cooper ?

why , they 're just toy ?
they 're mint in box .
they 're collectable .
no !
once you open the box it loses it value .
the nun always chaparoned the dance at my high school . they use to make u leave room between u for the holy spirit .
hindu do the same thing . except they leave room for a cow .
listen , i love your charm racist humour , but any chance you could not knock my religion while she 's here .
it 's different . you 're people do n't worship lox .
so , arrange marriage . the parent just decide , and then you have to get married ?
excuse me , be you rajesh ?
nice to meet you too .
hello .
and this be howard .
you too .
i need to speak with you .
it be not the only logical explanation . for example , you could be hallucinate after be hit on the head by , say , a coconut .
i 'm not go to dignify that with a response . now , to the matter at hand . you need to play with the transporter toy .
yes , and to open it would destroy it 's value . but remember , like me , you also have a human half .
consider this . what be the purpose of a toy ?
therefore ? to not play with it would be ?
my goodness , that be delicious .
impressive . what go into make something like that .
four miss call , two text message , and a fail video chat . i win . so , what be we go to tell them .
me too . but before we get their hope up we should probably make sure we 're on the same page .
i 'm gay .
i know a fake marriage be n't an honest way to live , but you of all people must know how difficult it be to come out in our culture .
well , there be a rumour back in new delhi that you 're , how shall we say , comfortable in a sari .
really ? the chocolate lava cake ? the little soap in the bathroom ? and i 'm sorry , but you 're wear more perfume than i be .
get you .
if i told you to jump off the bridge of the enterprise , would you do it ?
well i be unhappy .
i come from a factory in taiwan . now do the right thing .
fine . i will just use the transporter . oh , right . you broke it .
very well . cooper to enterprise , one to beam up . energise . ah . tiny spock . help .
ready for lunch ?
yep , one sec . ah , good . ma would have kill me if she 'd found out i 'd broke my retainer .
hey , uh , can i run something by you ? it 's about lakshmi .
yeah . sure . how be thing go ?
then why do she even go out with you ?
she be look for a husband so she can appear to be straight . and you know , it sound crazy to me at first , but i 'm actually think about do it .
okay , well , so the reason that might sound crazy , be 'cause it 's crazy .
look , howard , you 're in a relationship . you know you have to make compromise .
because this one want to marry me . i might never find another one who do .
so you 're seriously think about marry someone you 're never go to have sex with .
i ca n't believe your attitude . i thought you be in favour of gay people get married .
yes , to other gay people .
do you hear how homophobic you sound ?
oh , i do n't want a broken toy . nothing !
what ?
nothing . i say nothing .
that be weird .
really ? i do n't even notice any more .
i can not believe you guy be n't go to play with these .
well i told you , you do n't , it 's mint in box .
i dunno . i just think it 's a waste . relax . i 'm just look at the box .
perhaps you should look with your eye , and not your muscular nebraska man-hands .
what be your problem ?
my problem be that i do n't want you to break leonard 's toy , which you probably do by shake it . she shook it . we all saw her .
leonard , i bought you this because i want you to have fun with it . i do n't want it to just sit in this box .
you know , you 're right . i mean , it 's from you , i 'm never go to sell it . i 'm opening it .
yes .
it 's broken .
what ?
oh , nice job , man-hands .
i do n't break it . i , i guess stuart sell it to me like this .
yes . yes , he do , that be a perfectly satisfy and plausible explanation . yeah , let 's all be mad at stuart .
you know , i paid a lot for this . let 's take it over there and show him .
absolutely .
i do n't . that be a lie . i open my own toy . and it be already broken so i switch them .
well , you should talk to stuart .
i ca n't because that be a lie . yours be broken in an earthquake . and that 's a lie .
okay , that i believe .
mmm .
leonard , penny , i just , i want you both to know that i regret my action toward the two of you . that 's a lie .
so , be that one mine .
yes .
well , hand it over so i can open it .
okay . leonard , even though i do n't have one any more , i hope you have fun play with it .
big fat whopper . i hope it break .
raj , howie told me what 's go on with you and lakshmi .
what , you told her ?
we believe there 's someone out there who 'll love you for you .
well , actually we kind of agree to disagree on that one , but we both think you should n't marry this woman .
not necessarily . i think we 've found someone for you to cuddle with .
oh , my goodness . be n't you the cutest little yorkie ever ? you get him for me ?
her . we thought you two would hit it off .
metrosexual my as .
so , i get the craziest e-mail this morning .

believe me , i know . the e-mail i get be from the office of stephen hawk .
why ?

that 's amaze . you 'll be like his pit crew . a word of caution , i would not do your stephen hawk impression in front of him .
you 're right . i suppose that could be consider offensive .
oh , boy , sheldon 's go to freak out .

i be actually think about bring him along when i go over there so he can meet the great man .

hi . here be the make-up sponge you ask for .
damn , you 've get more makeup than i do . you 've get well makeup than i do . yeah , i 'm borrowing this .
hey , hey , hey , hey . this be my comic-con makeup . i love you , but there be some thing a man do n't share with his girlfriend .
that 's a wise policy . i once borrow my sister 's makeup for a costume contest . get a terrible case of pinkeye . but luckily , i be go a a zombie . i won second place .
i feel like you guy just go to comic-con .
that be san diego comic-con . this be bakersfield comic-con .
be that well ?
well , it 's a lot small . it 's more about the comic book . the way these convention use to be before they go all hollywood .
so to answer your question , no , it 's not well .
it 's a comic book convention . you know , it 's like pizza or particle accelerator , even the stinky one 's still pretty good .
okay .
oh , hang on a second . hold this .
what be that for ?
to show people when they do n't believe me .
oh , this be the best . you have booze with breakfast on a tuesday , you get a problem . you do it on the weekend , you get brunch .
he 's not exhaust at all .
it 's cute how excite they be . you should have see howard sew his costume all week for the convention .
when he be a little boy , every couple month , he would have to let his mom 's pant out .
i do n't even understand why they go to these convention .
i do n't mind it . i think howie 's just in touch with his inner child . although when he come to bed in his batman pyjama , sometimes it feel like i 'm touch his inner child .
i 've never even read a comic book . you guy ?
uh-uh .
i mean , it 's such an important part of their life . maybe we should try reading some .
i think you should turn on the gps .
but the turn-by-turn voice option be n't on . i know i 'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option . i love the turn-by-turn voice option .
leonard , bear left and continue on interstate _ .
ooh , sound like that fellow know what he 's talk about . i 'd put on my listen ear if i be you .
what do you do ?
that be so cool .
continue on interstate _ for five mile . here 's an interest fact about interstate .
really ?
interstate be numbered a follow . even-numbered route run east and west , odd-numbered route run north and south . three-digit route number indicate bypass or spur .
look , leonard , there 's a bridge . drive off it .
you know , we 're not that far from vazquez rock .
oh , they shot a lot of star trek episode out there .
we 've get our costume in the trunk . we could go there and have a little photo shoot .
great idea . i have n't have a carbohydrate in two week . these cheekbone need to be in front of a camera before i eat a pretzel and they 're go .
yeah , that sound fun .
oh , smash . now , leonard , do you know how to get there ?
recalculate . while we 're wait , do you know which president sign the intestate highway system act into law ? the answer , come up in _ mile .
why be they star ?
oh , hey . could you please stop star ? they 're just girl . it 's nothing you have n't see in movie or in drawing .
oh , well , i recommend you do n't open a store and sell them .
well , uh , let 's see . you 've get your basic clean-cut good guy , superman , spider-man , captain america . then you have your darker anti-heroes , your batman , your wolverine , punisher .
ooh , i do love a bad boy .
if i be you , i 'd go for fable number one . the artwork be sophisticated , it 's intelligently write , and it do n't objectify or stereotype woman .
and we 're blending , and we 're blending , and we 're do .
i know mr data be n't suppose to smile , but here it come .
come on , guy . let 's do this .
yeah , i 'm sweat my bald cap off .
so what 's our first pose go to be ?
i say we begin with a classic star trek fight scene .
i 'll set the timer .
sheldon , how be that a fight pose ?
mr data 's weapon be his mind . i 'm wield it .
phasers on the borg ! charlie 's angel .
oh , my god . leonard , someone 's steal your car !
what ? hey , hey ! come back here !
stop !
steal be against the law !
i do n't believe this .
son of a bitch .
i 'll call _ . what , oh , no , my phone be in my other pant .
oh , so be mine .
mine , too . anybody get any idea ?
what kind of a person steal another person 's car in broad daylight ?
what kind of person leaf his key in the car ?
i thought we agree this be all koothrappali 's fault .
you 're right . nice go .
car .
what be wrong with people ? why do n't they stop ?
maybe we 're well off . what if we be to get in a car with a crazy person ?
look at u , sheldon . we 're the crazy people .
well , perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorist of our mental competence .
good idea . why do n't you get start on that ?
come on , let 's just start walk . there 's get to be a gas station or something nearby .
yes .
all right .
i do n't know , there be a lot of picture , and one page only have the word brakkadoom !
well , there be a lot of action .
mmm .
and the story move along at a brisk pace . it be , overall , what 's the word i 'm look for ?
stupid ?
so stupid .
it 's crazy , they spend hour argue about thing that do n't even exist .
what a waste of time .
i do n't think it 's heavy . it 's some sort of magic , so only thor can lift it .
no .
yes .
well , which be it ?
okay .
you want some tea ?
good idea . i 'll help you .
wait , i thought we be reading .
we be . we 're just , uh , give you a head start .
i wish my mom be here . we could all hang out in her shadow .
wool pant in the desert . i feel like i 've get poach testicle .
oh , you poor thing , you 're sweat . that 's so much bad than have your car steal .
insurance be gon na buy you a new car . it 's not gon na de-funk my junk .
nerd !
hold on , who decides who 's worthy ? do the hammer decide ?
yes !
no ! it ca n't decide . it 's a hammer .
you say it 's a magic hammer .
yeah , but , it ca n't make decision .
if harry potter 's wand can make decision , why ca n't thor 's hammer ?
okay , if you 're go to start compare wand and hammer , i ca n't even take you seriously .
hello . hello . uh , uh , uh , four glass of water , please . anything for you guy ?
why do n't you ask scotty to beam you up ?
scotty be on the original series , and we 're next generation . so , joke 's on you .
we 're not with him .
you ca n't pick something up in outer space . in space , there be no up .
oh , yeah ? then how do the sun come up every day ?
be there anything valuable in the car ?
our clothes , our wallet , phone .
makeup ? sure .
i do n't know , sound pretty cool .
it , it be . it 's not just comic book . they 've get action figure , toy , a tron-themed dance party .
i think i have all i need here . you guy need me to call someone ? i 'm guess your mom ?
thanks , but we 've get it cover .
okay , i just talk to my mom . she arrange for u to get a rental car .
great . we can still make it to comic-con .
be you kid me ? after all we 've be through , i just want to go home .
do n't be like that . come on , howard , talk to him .
fine , then i guess it 's two against two . how do we decide ?
actually , it 's three against one .
well , what if the hulk picked up thor while thor be hold the hammer ?
then by the transitive property of pick thing up , hulk picked up the hammer .
no . hulk picked up thor , thor picked up the hammer .
okay , hang on . if i go to a bar and pick up a guy , and he pick up a girl , and then we all leave together , do i pick up the girl ?
do that ever happen ?
hey , be we talk about me or be we talk about thor ?
well , i say that 's the last time we ever go outside .
look , right here . red hulk be pick up thor 's hammer 'cause thor 's touch it .
no , it 's because they 're in space . he 's really just touch the strap .
be they actually argue about comic book ?
no , that ca n't be right .
then red hulk must be worthy .
you do n't know his life .
if it 's an alternate dimension , sound like a job for a land party .
captain , what be your order ?
i say we investigate .
wait . they might be hostile .
yes !
sheldon , your food 's get cold .
i 'll eat later . right now , i 'm suckle at the informative bosom of mother physic .

sheldon , kripke 's not smarter than you . you just get stuck on a wrong path . happen to einstein . he get stuck on the unified field theory for decade .
oh , do n't play the einstein card . his great breakthrough happen when no one knew anything . so everything be a great breakthrough .
sheldon lee cooper , i do not have time for this nonsense . now , go put your clothes on , get in the car , and let go to work .

i do n't believe you . howie , we ca n't afford to waste money on junk like this .
all right , i do n't understand . why do n't you just tell kripke the truth ?
because the truth make me look bad , whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie make me look good . anyway , if kripke asks , tell him my coitus with amy be frequent , intense and whimsically inventive .

that be what i write on the bathroom wall . for a whimsically inventive time , call leonard hofstadter .
i know you 're joking , but i 'd be okay with that .

because she 's your friend , and she do a nice job . i 'm sure she 'd like to hear it .
all right .
i do n't mean now . hello ? yeah , yeah , you want a cigarette . well , i 'd like a normal boyfriend . deal with it .

oh , so many crazy rule .
that well be tootsie roll you 're throw at me !
penny . penny . penny . oh yeah , much well .
what ?
amy point out to me that since you do something nice for me , i 'm obligate to do something nice for you . so , yes , i 'll go to your dopey play .
why not ?
you should go 'cause you want to go , not because you have to .
oh , dear lord , more rule ? where do it stop ? can i want to go because i have to want to go ?
okay . do whatever you want .
yeah , but now , wait . do whatever i want ? or whatever i have to want ?
oh , for god 's sake , just come to the play .
he 's upset because he ca n't get anywhere with woman .
uh , yeah .
come on , she come back . this be good news . you should celebrate .
i do n't want to celebrate .
not even a little ? i mean , we could have a pant party . go put some on .
why would i want her number ? i do n't want anything to do with this woman .
boy , i want to tell you it 's her loss , but you be not make it easy .
you 're , you 're a good friend for try to help , but , i 've make my choice .
all right . well , i 'll see you around .
okay .
i must be strong so i do n't stray from my true purpose , the study of the universe .
all right . thanks for ruin lobster for me .
wait ! give me the number ! give me the number ! give me the number !
so , amy , what 's go on with your addiction study ?
why ? what happen ?
typical bureaucratic nonsense . you can get animal addict to a harmful substance , you can dissect their brain , but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you 're unprofessional .
i 'm sorry . that i ask .
all right , let 's get this stupid play over with .
uh , hang on . empty your pocket .
why ?
you know why . the nintendo d . and the psp . now the gameboy .
aw , for pete 's sake . can we go now ?
well , be that all of it ? just set it down .
just so you know , this be not a stupid play . a streetcar name desire be an american classic .
it 's about streetcar ? oh , great . i wo n't need this .
hi .
oh , no , i ca n't stay .
no , it 's not any of that . it 's just , i kind of have a hard time around people i do n't know .
i 've be try to force myself into situation that i 'm not comfortable with . i saw the flyer in the store window , and i make myself go in . i do n't even like comic book .
then what be you do there ?
well , how do i know you 're not just say that ?
okay . text me . bye .
you wo n't regret it . i 'm the most pathetic guy you 've ever met . and that , boy and girl , be how it 's do .
yes .
to be lonely ?
she 's pretty good , huh ?
she 's remarkable .
she really be .
our penny 's a star .
how can she remember all those line , but a a waitress , she ca n't remember no tomato on my hamburger ?
i get whine .
come on , if i be any good at convincing woman to do stuff , i would n't have spent so much of my twenty in the shower .
if you ask me , this whole thing be a waste of our time .
help woman ? y
help anyone . people should take care of themselves .
oh , like yesterday , when you make me drive you to the dry cleaner , the pharmacy and the post office ?
i 'm not say people ca n't use tool . even an otter pick up a rock when he want a clam .
you do n't think it 's worthwhile to try to get more woman work in science .
i think that 's incredibly sexist of you . i believe in a gender-blind society like in star trek , where woman and men of all race and creed work side by side a equal .
you mean where they be advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive , but a black lady still answer the space phone ?
howard 's disturb recollection aside , i do n't appreciate be force to do banal committee work .
yes , i know , you 're too smart for this .
exactly . it 's like ask the human torch to heat up your frozen burrito .
get it . all right , i 'm think one way to counter bias in the peer-review process , be for paper to be submit under gender-neutral name . like s smith instead of samantha smith .
i suppose there be a history of professional woman use their initial so a not to be pre-judged . harry potter 's j.k rowling , uh , star trek 's d.c fontana .
van nuys pole-dancer d.d . melon . all right , i think we 've really help woman today . let 's fire up the old xbox .
we 're not . this time you 're the smart kid do all the work while the even smarter kid sit back and watch .
so , you think i 'm one of the smarter kid ?
no , you 're a tool i be use to make my point .
guy , our topic be encourage woman in science , can you at least play a less sexist game
how be it sexist ? my character wields a battle axe a well a any man .
not to mention she have mammary gland that could nurse a family of _ . and have enough milk left over to open a baskin robbins .
mother , warrior-princess , franchise owner , i hear glass ceiling shatter all over town .
that 's actually good . why do n't i think of that ?
some people be otter , some people be rock .
i wonder if there 's a way we could give the idea a trial run .
maybe i could call my old middle school , see if we can talk to some of the female student .
that 's great , try to set up something for the three of u to go over there .
what exactly be you look up ?
how do i get 12-year-old girl excite .
no !

let 's think .
hmm . we do just disney or california adventure , too ?
it 's nice of your old school to let u try out our science talk on some female student .
well , they 're actually pretty excite . i 'm their most famous alum . if you do n't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitute .
this must feel pretty good for you , come back to your alma mater a an astronaut .
yeah , last time i be here , i be just a scrawny little nerd .
what ?

he 's our guest , we ca n't just ask him to straighten our closet .
no , we would n't ask him . we 'd just show him the closet and let the goblin in his head take it from there .
thanks . and , sheldon , i know tonight 's the night you eat thai food , so i go to the asian market , get all the ingredient and make it from scratch .
oh , it 's my pleasure .

whoa , you open this ?
well , i have to find out if it be personal correspondence or memorabilia . now , a i be say , base on the content
howard , do n't you want to know what 's in the letter ?
if i want to know , i would 've open it year ago . the closet look great . let 's get out of here .
wait , can i bring this box of extra shirt button to sort on the ride ?
do whatever you want .
thanks . oh . great party .
you know , when i first met howard , he would pull his scrotum out of his short and say , aw , i sat in gum .
what be your point ?
well , it 's just kind of weird how grown up he be now . happily married guy throw dinner party .
really ? you could n't just say that ? you have to tell the scrotum story ?
try to paint a picture .
it be a nice change of pace not eat takeout around a coffee table .
mm , you know , we could throw a dinner party , too . maybe even ask everyone to get dress up .
sure . just , when you say dress up , you mean nice clothes , right ? not , like , cape and tights and crap ?
yeah . although
howie , you okay ?
told you you should n't have espresso after dinner . i know the little cup make you feel big , but it 's not worth it .

why do you even care ? just tell u what it say .
control over the information contain in that letter belongs to howard . by happenstance , i come to know it . that do n't give me the right to disseminate it freely .
come on . look , the letter be found in bernadette 's closet . do n't that count for something ?
be you point out that california be a community property state , and since howard and bernadette be married , the intellectual property contain in that letter be jointly own by the two spouse ?
yeah , obviously .
well played . sometimes i do n't give you enough credit , penny .
dude , you make the right choice come to me for help with this party .

sheldon .
it be a map lead to the lose treasure of famous pirate one-eyed willy .

amy .
you do n't know it , but your father be in the auditorium at your high school graduation . and he cry because he be so proud of you .

or that 's complete poppycock which amy make up . it still could be the map .
i would like to change mine . the pirate 's name be peg-leg antoine . now it 's completely different from goony .

that 's more like it .
glad you 're feel well .
me , too . if i 'd know we be gon na be dance , would have worn my flat .
this turn out pretty well , huh ?
yeah , i think so .
i agree . that be , if you 've never be to or heard of a party before .
if you 'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place , you 'd be happy all the time .
uh , penny , i , i have a couple of question about your closet . be there any reason you 're keep this dead goldfish ?
damn , i forgot to feed him . and that i have him .
well , now , do you also have a dog ? because i found what appear to be a battery-operated chew toy .
and the next wedding gift be a gravy boat .
ooh , one gravy boat .
in the event of a divorce , please return to sheldon cooper .
one inappropriate , yet i wish i thought of that gravy boat .
when i get married i 'm go to register at the ucla cadaver lab .
ew , why ?
so , you actually see you and sheldon get married someday ?
what about you , penny ?
do you think you and leonard might ever get married ?
but do you think you 'll ever get married ?
he 's a sweetie .
you 're not answer the question . do you love him ?
it do n't sound like it .
do you tell him that ?
no , he 'd just take it the wrong way .
what do that mean ?
be you gon na break up with him ?
oh , that 's not really a fair comparison . i 'm basically married to a sexy buzz lightyear .
amy , you ?
ca n't help ya , kid . whenever i 'm around sheldon , i feel like my loin be on fire . in the good way . not the urinary tract infection way .
hey , buddy , how 's it go up there ?
you do n't have to shout , raj . it 's not like i 'm an astronaut float around in outer space . oh , wait , i be .
so , be it everything you hop it would be ?
hey , froot loop , do you clean the space toilet ?

okay , my turn . let me talk to him .
go ahead .
yes , i read you , sheldon .
copy that . over .
what be you do ?
i be talk to a man in space . if you do n't have the then he might a well be at the coffee bean over on lake street .
you 're out of your mind , sheldon .
come on , scrub it up , loop .

bye .
over and out .
hello .
um , raj invite me to go to the movie with you guy .
excuse me . i do n't authorize this .
sheldon , you be not in charge .
that 's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner .
what 's the big deal ? you guy be bring your girlfriend . i do n't want to sit by myself .
the big deal be i be expect u to be an intimate group of five . now , we 're go to be a faceless mass of six .
i can take them or leave them .
would you feel more comfortable if i ate raisinets ?
okay . should we go ?
all right .
i go to art school .
equally ridiculous . let 's go .
this insistence on hand-holding be preposterous .
well , i like it .
yeah , of course you do . you 're a girl . you like all kind of hippy-dippy thing .
just watch the movie .
it 's not fair . penny be n't make leonard hold hand .
there might be a reason for that .
sweaty ? unhygienic ? look dumb ? take your pick .
penny say she 's not sure she want to be leonard 's girlfriend anymore .
wrong . she just take a sip from his diet dr pepper .
so ?
so , if she want to end her pair-bond with leonard , why on earth would she guzzle a witch ' brew of his soda and spit ?
regardless , do n't say anything to leonard .
now you 're ask me to keep a secret from my best friend , colleague , and roommate ?
yes , please , penny will kill me .
raisinet ?
shh , we 're try to watch the movie . this be not work out with him .
what be you do ?
i think i might have tartar buildup . my tongue wo n't go a far forward a it use to .
maybe your tongue be shrink .
nope . oh , you have no idea how annoy this be .
i 'm start to get a sense of it . do n't worry . i 'll take you to the dentist tomorrow .
thank you . i appreciate that . you 're good people , leonard . there 's something i need to tell you .
okay .
i ca n't tell you .

i ca n't tell you why i ca n't tell you . so i guess there 's two thing i ca n't tell you .
i wish there be more .
good night . i 'm sorry . this be really important .
what be it ?
i like the transformer . do you like the transformer ?
okay , i think i understand .
you do ?
the guy who seem like an emotionless robot be you , but your relationship with amy be cause you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desire .
that be literally the stupidest thing i 've ever heard .
leonard ? leonard ? leonard ?

oh , i be have a little trouble sleep and i just thought , uh , see a you 're up , we could talk .
talk about what ?
oh , i do n't know , uh , weather , uh , fish you could do carpentry with , why leonard be such an attractive and desirable boyfriend . yeah , pick one , your choice .
sheldon .
do you know that leonard have a perfect drive record and enjoys the insurance discount that go along with that ? hubba-hubba .
yeah . do you know that while leonard be not consider a tall fellow in our country , in today 's north korea , he 's downright average . hey , talk about a keeper .
okay , what do amy tell you ?
excuse me . this be not about protect my friend . i 'm a big fan of homeostasis . do you know what that be ?
of course not .
homeostasis refers to a system 's ability to regulate it internal environment and maintain a constant condition of property like temperature or ph .
okay , honey , i have a lot to figure out , and until i do , you be not to say a word to leonard . do you understand ?
i do . you clear on the shampoo issue ?

yeah , just a heads-up : penny know that you blabbed about leonard . she 's pretty mad .
i know . she 's yell at me right now .
all right then , so we 're all on the same page . yes .
there 's my hubby . how 's everything go up there ?
what 's wrong ?
howard .
oh , howie .
why do n't you stand up to them ?
i do n't know . say , be mean be lame , what 's cool be be nice .
no . my mom already try that . it only make thing bad .
gelatinous sphere .
temple of yip .
all right , lesser demon turtle .
fairy god monster , i win . your desperate need for friendship make you weak .
we 're gon na try to meet some girl .
watch out , lady , a little coffee and cream come your way .
in case you do n't follow that , i 'm the coffee .
leonard ? maybe you 'd like to go with them to meet girl .
no , please do n't ruin this for me .
yes , you walk around for a week say , sheldon unhappy with cast choice .
but , then mark ruffalo be the hulk in the avenger , and he be even well .
what 's your point ?
call me a romantic . i like to think that your mark ruffalo be still out there somewhere .
yeah , settle down there , fake wolowitz . no one like a kiss-up .
so , i have to take sheldon to the dentist this morning .
really ?
yup . i told him if he do n't bite the hygienist , i 'd take him for ice cream .
mmm .
i do n't have to take him for ice cream .
uh-huh .
you okay ? you seem a little distract .
oh . yeah , okay .
i do n't really know how to say this .
just say it .
okay . here go .
mm-hmm .
you slept with him ?
oh , sure , you have no choice .
he look at me like this .
do n't worry . you 'll have plenty of chance to break up with him . your wedding day , your honeymoon , your 50th anniversary .
look , it 's fine . we 're not get married , okay ? we 're keep thing , you know , homeostasis .
it 's so cute when she try .
oh , howie .
i be reading about this jellyfish that never dy . instead , it reverts to it asexual state and then grows up again .
we thought my 90-year-old grandfather have revert to an asexual state , but the lawsuit from his jamaican caregiver prove u all wrong .
my point be , immortality be not only a possibility , it be real .
only if you 're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm .
wemember when we be twying to figuwe out what that smell come fwom pwofessor tupperman 's office be ?
turn out it be tupperman . dead at his desk for two week .
that 's terrible .
in wieu of fwowers , the department chair be ask that evewyone donate a bottle of febweze .
if we 're go to change the topic from jellyfish , i 'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle .
well , i believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure .
if you need my nose , you 'll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee .
no . i mean , i 'll apply , but i 'm not gon na stoop to play politics .
yeah , me neither . it should be about the work . and if i ca n't get tenure , i 'd like to see you or sheldon get it .
excuse me , but i think i 'm just a qualify a you be .
pchew ! pchew ! pchew ! pchew !
so tenure mean a job for life ?
yup .
you ca n't get fire even if you 're bad at it ?
mm , not really .
wow , sound a lot like be a pretty waitress at the cheesecake factory .
while i disagree with the premise of tenure , if they give it to me , it would n't diminish my output . you know , i 'm like the sun . ca n't turn this off .
be rajesh and leonard compete for it a well ?
mm-hmm .
do they know they do n't stand a chance 'cause you 're so great ?
well put . you know , i must say i go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing , but those moment when you worship me really keep you in the run .
i think that 's enough wine for now .
i just keep think about how cool it would be if i call my mom and told her that i get tenure at caltech .
she 'd be proud , huh ?
my primary concern with be grant tenure be living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact . i might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow . or a chainsaw .
or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out , buy a house , get married . start a family .

oh . well , in that case , perhaps i should come along .

she plan on flirt with member of the tenure committee to far leonard 's cause .

oh , you do what you want , but i do n't want to lose my friend over tenure . friend be forever .
i 'm just gon na go home and let my work speak for itself .
you 're right . this be beneath me . lie your mother be last night .

i do n't know . it 's a fat guy on a segway . that 's funny everywhere .
i 'm delete it .
well , hang on . maybe the chinese have n't finish watch it yet .
you know , if you 're try to make space on the dvr , why do n't you just get rid of some of the stuff you 've already watch ? like , um , alpha .

there be no season three . they cancel that show .
well , they ca n't cancel it . it end on a cliffhanger .
they do .

that show end with all the resident of new york either dead or unconscious . oh , now i 'll never know what happen .
i feel bad for whoever get that phone call .

she say she recently go on a date with a guy name roger ? and he 's indian ? and he 's an astrophysicist , too ?
you know what 's go on , do n't you ?
yes , mummy be right . american girl be sexually voracious devil .
i ca n't believe i have to explain this . people change name on blog to protect their privacy . roger be raj .
oh . i always thought , if i have a white name , it would be gavin .
keep reading . what do it say ?
no , no , i do n't know if i should . if she want me to know about her blog , she would 've told me . it 's almost like i 'm reading her diary .
it 's exactly what it 's like . keep reading .
no , this be creepy .
oh , i think we be look at creepy in the rearview mirror when i put up that camera .
it 's six thirty in the morning .
i 'm sorry you 're upset . you know , sheldon , sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moment like this .
i be not fly back to texas just so my mom can give me a hug .
okay . well , what i think be go on here be you have a pathological need for closure .
oh , that 's nonsense . i mean , you tell me story about your day all the time . i do n't care how they end .
you know , i might be able to help you with this . there 's a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines way to retrain your neural pathway so stuff like this bother you less .
you sure about that ?
oh , quite sure . that prof nothing .
ready to go to lunch ?
do you think i 'm feminine ?
yeah . let 's go .
thanks a lot .
what 's go on ?
i broke down , and i read lucy 's blog , and in one of the entry she say , when we first met , i struck her a a little feminine .
just a little ? that 's great .
i have to talk to her about this .
oh , geez , why do you girl always want to talk about thing ? listen to me , if she 's write about your relationship , use it to your advantage . rig the game .
well , that do n't seem fair .
be it fair that girl like confident , normal guy more than nervous weirdo ?
no , it 's not . i 've always thought that be unfair .
so take what 's in that blog and use it to get her pant off .
why do you have to make everything so filthy ? why could n't you just say the blog be like her give me the key to her heart ?
the key to her heart . that 's nice . be you quote someone or be it tattooed on the small of your back ?
i be quote a man who know a thing or two about woman , sir elton john .
so , do you love it ? of course you love it . how could you not love it ? tell me how much you love it .
it be cute .
oh , do n't say cute . that 's the bad .
what 's wrong with cute ?
it just make thing seem small . it diminishes them .
so you want me to stop call your little tushy cute ?
you can try , but nobody 's gon na believe you . i just , i do n't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excite by it .
i like it . i 'm excite .
well , then , tell your face .
what do you want from me ?
you know what ? never mind . we give it a shot . let 's just see what else be on .
oh , come on , do n't be like that .
well
i 'm sorry i call it cute . let 's watch another one .
really ?
yeah , it be fun . kind of remind me of my high school . but instead of vampire , we have meth head . but both come out at night and have mess up teeth .
oh . well , that 's like my high school , too . but instead of a curse , it be crab .
i 've come up with a series of exercise to help with your compulsive need for closure .
i take issue with the word compulsive .
all i 'm say be , we live in a world where closure be n't always an op
…tion . okay . for the sake of argument , let 's say i have a problem . what would be your plan for address it ?
i 'm go to recondition your brain so that the need for completion be n't so overwhelm .
by play tic-tac-toe ?
exactly . how do that make you feel ?
the same way any normal person would . i feel like i want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until i have a handful of sheldon-face confetti .
or you could pitch in , grab a nostril and help me get this face off .
come on , you can do this .
you do n't know what it 's like to feel completely frustrate . to have a desire build up within you and be deny any opportunity for release .
yeah , sound like a drag .
well , there be action , it be funny . i mean , you do get that usually the monster chase the pretty girl , but this time the pretty girl chase the monster ?
well , there 's no reason you ca n't .
absolutely . all we need to do be spend a little time and find something you 're passionate about .
ugh , that sound like a lot of work .
hey , what 's up ?
uh , lucy 's come over . i need some advice .
however long you think the foreplay should be , triple it .
just tell me which one you think be more manly . this hockey jersey or this football jersey .
i do n't know . go with hockey .
hi .
oh , look how cute your little doggy be .
yeah , well , i would n't get too close . if i give the right command in german , she 'll rip your face off .
o'er the land of the free , and the home of the next .
that 's quite an impressive layout , be n't it ?
yes .
let 's box it up .
that 's enough . sheldon , sheldon , give it !
okay , sheldon , make a wish and blow out the candle . oops , miss one . now your wish ca n't come true .
i like your jersey .
oh , cool . so do my dad . we watch it all the time grow up . who 's your favourite player ?
it 's still a little frozen in the middle .
well , you 're act all weird , and i 'm pretty weird , so i think i know what i 'm talk about .
i think i 'm gon na go . thank you for the burrito and the pork rind and the 20-minute lecture on why monster truck be well than regular truck .
why be you act so strange tonight ?
raj , i do n't say feminine be a bad thing . i meant that you 're sweet and thoughtful and your skin look so much like caramel , i just want to dip an apple in your face .
so , be you okay ?
good . do you even like hockey ?
no . bought this at the staple center when i go to see taylor swift .
so , i be think how excite you get about stuff like buffy or science or which tv remote you and sheldon should buy .
the harmony one be fine . we do n't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred , which he know be too big for my hand .
see , that 's the kind of passion i do n't think i have . but then i realize i 'm passionate about you .
that 's a big deal .
it be , be n't it ?
so , do that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool show or get dress up in match costume and go to comic-con ?
leonard , i have an epiphany , not a stroke .
amy , i must say , i be sceptical at first , but this have truly be a transformative even .

hey , do n't discourage him . this be a fantastic opportunity .
no one ask you , uhura .
would you like to hear a classic sheldon cooper factoid ?
what do you think ?
interest that you would bring that up when i might go work on a boat .
well , that 's the thing about factoid , they 're interest .
i know what you 're do . you do n't want me go on this research trip because you 're afraid to be alone .
i 'm not afraid to be alone . on land . on the sea , it would be terrify . because of all the drown .
sheldon .
fine , no more drown talk . i 'll change the subject . oh . who do you think would win in a fight , you or a shark ?
very well . thing between you and penny have never be well . i hope four month apart do n't change anything . i should have open with that , huh ?

you know that 's the first time you ever say that you love me .
yeah .
we 're just suppose to pretend it 's not a big deal ?

million dollar camera , ten dollar lock .
oh , my god , here he come . this be it .
what the hell be that thing ?
i do n't know .
this be dr sheldon cooper . experimental log . wormhole generator test forty-four .
wormhole generator test ?
the first forty-three parallel universe i 've checked prove to be empty . i see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different .
oh , my god !
holy crap !
oh ! it 's eat my face !
aah ! it 's eat his face !
i found your webcam and replace the video feed . you two should be ashamed of yourselves .
sheldon , we 're really sorry .
but what be you do in there ?
and what do forty-three mean ?
you do n't need to know , you do n't deserve to know , and you will never know .
yeah , well , i know how to make your egg salad now .
your hypothesis be completely disconfirmed by all the data . you 're just cling to it out of intellectual stubbornness .
no , you 're display a shock ignorance of the subject matter . mummy and zombie be the exact same thing .
oh , yeah ? mummy be wrap in bandage .
that 's call a fashion choice .
good boy . here 's a cookie .
oh , thank you .
hey , fella , what 's go on ?
oh , mummy and zombie again .
thanks . guess who picked up his new car this morning ?
yep . for a long a i can keep my mother out of it . if you want to check it out later , it 's park right out front , space _ .
i 'm sorry , _ ?
yeah .
that 's my parking spot .
why do you have a parking spot ? you do n't have a car . you do n't even drive .
it do n't matter . that 's my spot .
maybe they reassign it because you never use it .
well , i 'm not use my nipple , either . maybe they should reassign those .
fun story . meanwhile , you still do n't have a car .
do n't try to change the subject . this be about a parking space . it have nothing to do with car .
be you listen to yourself ?
i always listen to myself . it 's one of the great joy of my life . now , get your car out of my spot .
nope .
very well . you leave me no choice .
well , he 's not wrong . howard do go to the international space station .
yeah , that be five week ago . how much longer be he gon na milk that cow ?
all that story do be make me feel bad for your mother .
leonard , you 're my best friend . why do n't you ever take my side ?
because i can never understand your side .
give it back .
i 'm sorry , but could you be more specific ?
sheldon , that be a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible , and i want it back .
i 'd love to help you out , but unfortunately , i 'm use it .
fine . i 'm take your diploma .
yeah . so , how you do ?
uh , no , they usually do n't have to go out and get more wax .
really ? only five ?
hey , anybody want a drink ?
okay . so , do you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight , too ?
i guess this be what we get for be with two testosterone-fueled alpha male . at some point , they 're bound to lock horn .
i 'm really sorry they take sheldon 's spot away . he should n't have to suffer just because howard 's such a big deal now .
what 's that suppose to mean ?
you 're right . and i 'm sure sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again , if and when he make a worthwhile contribution to science .
if and when ?
hang on . none of sheldon 's theory have ever be definitively proven . my husband actually go to outer space .
that 's an impressive accomplishment . he 's now an inspiration to million of american who know you do n't have to be special or even qualify to go into space .
okay , here 's another one : if a zombie bite a vampire , and the vampire bite a human , do the human become a vampire or a zombie ? or a zompire ?
sheldon ?
cookie .
i do n't have any .
well , i 'm not give it away .
hi sheldon .
he 's in my spot . leonard , make him stop be naked in my spot .
howard , what be you do ?
he be n't use it . and i need a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked as on .
get off there .
give me back my iron man helmet .
give me back my parking space .
you do n't need a parking space . you do n't have a car .
you do n't need an iron man helmet . you 're not iron man .

would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate ?
you 're both act like lunatic . it 's just a parking spot .
can you believe this guy ?
what i do n't believe be that you try to run him over .

so , i understand that you actually discover this element by mistake .
and some people in the science community be call it the wonder blunder .
it 's just such a fascinate story . your calculation be way off , but they find the element anyway . it 's like misread a treasure map and still find the treasure .
i know you do n't like it , but every time you do an interview , it raise the profile of the university . that translates to funding .
yeah , well , i 'm not just some train monkey dance for coin .
of course you 're not . people love train monkey .
how can you not be happy ? you 're tall , thin and famous . oh , my god , i 'm jealous of sheldon .

yeah , i know a little something about that .
i remember why it 's be a while . sheldon , i be actually talk about when i be a kid on star trek .
well , not everybody felt that way . a lot of people really hat the character , and some of them hat me because of it . i would do interview , and people would be mean to me .
that just happen to me . next time you 're stuck for a tweet , feel free to say what a jerk ira flatow be .
yeah , i 'm an author now , i do public speak , and i have my own web series about board game .

you 'd have no girlfriend to see you naked , you 'd try to fill the void with food , and i 'm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake .

come on , sheldon , you should go .
why ?
you actually get him to do it .
yeah , you keep say how much sheldon have affected all of u , but you 've clearly have an impact on him .
if that be true , i would n't still be living alone . well , not exactly alone . i do have a _ pound sack of rice with one of sheldon 's t-shirt on it .
i 'm tell you , sheldon care for you more than you think .
i do n't understand .

oh , madame curie .
that 's fine , she 's dead .
you okay ?
just really glad you 're back .
me , too . i get a lot of tv to catch up on .
i miss you .
to quote han solo , i know .
do you miss me ?
i would 've prefer to have you there with me .
oh .
or instead of me .

not until i get my kiss .
this be nice , that we all get to eat together .
absolutely .
hmm . can we maybe put the phone down and have an actualhuman conversation ?
we can , but thanks to steve job , we do n't have to .
guy , guy , you 're never gon na believe this .
what happen ?
congratulation .
what ? that 's great . guy .
oh , yeah
yay , penny .
what 's the show ?
um , nc ii or , you know , ncstd i do n't know , it 's , it 's , you know , it 's the one with the letter and i 'm gon na be on it !
what 's your part ?
um , i play a customer in a diner and i flirt with mark harmon .
ooh , mark harmon , he 's a dreamboat .
so it , it 's just flirt ?
well , yeah . why ?
uh , no reason . i just think it 's sexier when thing be left to the imagination .
he 's wrong .
so i read a study that say a man with a dog be three time more likely to get a woman 's phone number .
be it true even when the man let his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue ?
i do n't see why not .
if you 're really desperate to meet woman and like have food eat out of your mouth , i could set you up with my mom .
why be that funny ? that 's just unhygienic .
hey , guy , do n't forget , my episode 's on tv tomorrow night .
we 'll be there .
can we bring anything ?
leonard , do you think i 'm funny ?
no . do you ?
i think i 'm hysterical .
i take it back . that be funny .
the philosopher henri bergson say it 's funny when a human be behaves like an object .
i bet that bit kill at the chuckle hut .
oh , he do n't perform stand-up comedy , he be a philosopher .
you know , i think we 're zero in on your problem .
perhaps i 'll spend some time develop a unified theory of comedy , which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time . unless they 're german , 'cause that 's a tough crowd .
be you set on people laugh with you ? ‘ cause if you 're cool with at you
raj , when you say you be gon na bring a date to watch penny 's thing tonight , i do n't think you meant stuart .
not at all .
if you 're so intimidate by talk to attractive girl , maybe you should practice by talk to regular people .
or maybe just stop talk .
no , and that 's why he have erin pace rewire it
i 'm so proud of you .
we have n't even gotten to my scene yet .
i know , but you 're go to be a tv star and you have n't left me yet . that take gut .
i do n't know about you , but i 'm very uncomfortable with all this .
why ?
i 've never see this show before and now i 'm start with episode _ ? it 's unnatural .
really ? because
what 's wrong ?
well , the diner scene . where 's my diner scene ?
well , do n't ask me . until i see the prequel , i 'm lose .
what happen ?
they must 've cut it .
oh , penny , i 'm , i 'm sorry .
that stink .
i 'm sure you be great .
this do n't make any sense . i mean , i , i thought i do a , a really good job , i excuse me .
honey , you only have , like , three line . that be n't gon na happen anyway .
unbelievable .
oh , come on , no , that 's not what i meant .
i do n't , look , you know , word do n't always have to mean thing .
nope . uh , uh , i might not know what i meant , but i know that i do n't mean that . not this guy . oh , no way .
i want you , right now , to give me your _ % honest opinion .
right .
do you think i have what it take to really make it a an actress ?
yes .
so you think i 'll be on tv and in movie and win award .
honestly ?
yes , honestly .
i do n't .
how could you say that ?
i do n't know , i get all confuse when you say honestly .
should 've let sheldon come .
this be interest . apparently , a key component in some form of humour be the element of surprise .
well , that make sense . the prefrontal cortex be responsible for planning and anticipation , and patient with brain lesion on their
brain lesion !
sheldon , you scar me . that be n't funny .
or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex .
how about her ?
fine . how about that old lady with the walker ?
we 'll find somebody else .
kumquat ?
ointment ?
sure .
now , would you say ointment be more , equal to , or less funny than kumquat ?
i do n't think i want to go out with you anymore .
will you please stop joking around ? i 'm try to figure this out .
sheldon , how many word be you gon na go through ?
all right , baby , here 's the deal .
and you do n't get your part cut . yep , bunch of old guy rock out in a band , all with erectile dysfunction , you do n't get your part cut !
hey . can we talk ?
we can , but the part of penny might get cut .
that be really crappy of me . what you 're try to do be hard , but people do make it , and i really do believe you could be one of them .
thank you .
and to show you how much i believe in you , i kind of get you an audition .
be you serious ? for what ?
the new star war movie .
what ? how do you manage that ?
there 's this thing online , you put yourself on tape and just send it in , anyone can do it .
come on leonard , this be just a pr stunt .
so ? even if it be , you have a huge advantage because you 're an actual actress . most of the people do this be just weirdoes and nerd . wolowitz sent his in two day ago .
how about that lady in the sweat suit , speed-walking ?
hey .
where 's sheldon ?
that 's interest .
if you want him to stop , sometimes the easy thing to do be just fake a laugh .
no , of course not .
i do n't think you would .
please , i 've make plenty of girl laugh , sometimes just by ask them out . yeah ? well , i fake my orgasm .
yes , how much for a hundred long-stemmed red rose ? really ? how much for three ?
hey .
look , i know you be just try to help with your star war thing . i do n't mean to call it idiotic .
well , i do n't think you call it idiotic .
oh . sorry , i meant to . anyway , um , i be just upset with myself . i be n't mad at you . i just feel like everything be fall apart .
no , you 're not .
really ? ‘ cause this morning at starbucks , a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg . and it be n't the only one in there .
okay , listen to me , this be just a minor setback .
no , it 's not , okay ? i 've be out here for , like , ten year . i 've nothing to show for it .
well , you have me .
you 're right . i do have you . mm . let 's get married .
ooh . leonard hofstadter , will you marry me ?
um
do you seriously just say um ?
look , you know i love you but , but you 're , you 're drunk and sad and feel lose .
okay , so , so you do n't want to marry me ?
that be not what i say .
no , forget it . i take it back . offer 's off the table .
who 's in the mood to laugh ?
really not a good time .
i 'm gon na go .
no , no , i just need to be alone .
so , a sandwich , a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar . where be you go ?
to my room .
should i follow you ?
leonard , wait .
how about those guy on that bench over there ? they look pathetic . i bet we could talk to them .
yeah . good night .
smooth .
ca n't sleep ?
would you like to talk about it ?
penny propose , and i do n't say yes .
why not ?
that 's a good question .
do that mean the relationship be over ?
i do n't know .
why do n't you ask her ?
because i 'm afraid to know the answer .
well , i 'm sorry .
that 's it ? you 're not gon na make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment ?
no . you 're my friend , and , i 'm sorry .
do you just put a kick me sign on my back ?
how many time do i have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it 's empty ?
so be i .
it 's an outrage .

oh . oh , okay . good , good . so , it 's cool if i cry a little ?
yeah , i probably would n't .
look , you do the right thing last night . i be a mess . i be just frustrate because my career be go nowhere .
wow . that , that 's a big step .
i know .
so , well , before make any rash
i already quit .
and i support you .
no . you 're on vacation .
please . what if there 's a big breakthrough in science today and i 'm not there to see it ?

be you sure ? he 's tall , pale and awkward . that sound like your type .
should someone a lonely a you really be make fun of me ?
yeah , grow up , howard . god .
what do i do ? i do n't want to hurt his feeling .
maybe the problem be he think you 're available . do he know you 're date sheldon ?
i guess it have n't come up .
there you go .
and do sheldon know you 're date sheldon ?
i 'm sorry . who be you date ?

actually , i 'm at the cheesecake factory .
you get your job back . that be great news . i do n't want to say anything , but you be make the right choice . to plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane .
yeah . i 'm just return my uniform .
before we begin your guide meditation , close your eye and picture yourself in a peaceful environment .
now , take a deep , relax breath in through your nose . and let it out .
in .
and out .
what be i gon na do ? two in in a row ? where 's my lemonade ?
i do n't get it .
a fitting swan song to your career a a waitress , to forget my order one last time .
do you think quit my job be a mistake ?
do you see me drinking lemonade ?
no . i 'm serious .
why do you ask ?
because leonard just piss me off . be i be an idiot or not ?
no , i do n't think you be .
because he 's not like u , penny . we 're dreamer .
hey .
so , anyway , there 's this big , uh , rock and mineral show next week in santa monica .
oh . this be awkward . you thought i be gon na ask you to go with me to the mineral show .
yeah .
that 's what you all say . you just do n't want to go out with me because i have an off-putting personality .
do n't worry . i 'm use to it . i mean , i 'm big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever want to do anything with me .
it 's okay . i know i 'm a monster .
sweet . it 's a date .
friendship . which i would trade in a heartbeat for all of this .
the mineral and rock show ? that would be awful even without bert .
so what be i suppose to do now ?
prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring ?
this be n't funny . i 'm gon na have to tell him the truth , that even if i do n't have a boyfriend , i would n't be interested in him .
oh , i 've heard those word so many time . from linda nosenchuck , tammy rosenworcel .
padma kapur , neha chowdury .
marci grossman , lisa mazzarino .
megan pincus .
tammy cho .
oh , who be that girl from our starbucks ?
arlene russel .
yes . arlene . she write no way on both our cappuccino .
poor bert . that guy 's get a rough afternoon ahead of him .
that 's how you reject a guy .
okay , i do n't have time for this . i 'm just gon na go find him and be brutally honest .
he 'll be so upset . he 'll probably climb up the empire state building and start swat at plane .
you want u to talk to him ?
really ? you would do that ?
sure . we 've both be in his shoe . we 'll let him down with compassion and respect .
thank you .
let 's go .
so we tell him she 's a lesbian , right ?
of course we tell him she 's a lesbian .
i 've read that there be great yogi who have such mastery over their body they can draw water in through their genitals .
yeah , well , i do n't think we 're gon na get to do that today .
too bad . it seem like a good way to drink a milk shake without get brain freeze .
oh , hey .
and now we go to reverse warrior .
how do she get you to do yoga ?
well , to be honest , i thought she say yoda .
i 'm help him relax because , unlike you , he support me .
oh , how many time do i have to say it ? i support you .
sheldon , take a break .
namaste .
okay , if you support me , what be with that phone call ?
fine . i 'm not sure you should have quit . but if you care so much what i think , why do n't you ask me before you do it ?
oh , so now i need your permission ? would you have ask me before you quit your job ?
yes . i thought we be in the kind of relationship where we make decision together . if i 'm wrong , then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we 're actually in .
yeah , well , maybe we do .
i 'm willing to if you guy be .
no .
penny ?
okay , wait . what be we do ?
for some reason , we 're planning a future where we both live with sheldon forever .

i swear , i be on your side .
you keep say you 're on my side , but you do n't act like it .
he do that to me , too . why do we put up with it ?
listen , i could never do what you 're do , okay ? i would be terrify .
well , it 's scary for me , too .
i 'm fine with it .

sunday 's go .
not sunday , i love sunday .
so that 's it ? everything 's sell out ?
yeah .
i ca n't believe we 're not go .
it 's okay . you know , there , there 's always wondercon in anaheim , you know ? that , that 's just a good . excuse me .
oh , guy , this be really sad . and in a different way than it be twenty minute ago .
i ca n't believe we waste all that time on our hulk costume .
what ? you be all go a the hulk ?
not the same hulk . ferrigno , bana , norton and ruffalo .
yeah .
and we 're back to the first kind of sad .
gentleman , i have the solution to our comic-con problem . we do n't need them . i 'm start my own convention .
do what you want . we 're get scalp ticket .
i already found a guy online who 's willing to sell .
how do you know this be n't a sting operation set up by the comic-con police ?
the same way i know that the people in the tv set ca n't see me .
do you tell them that you 're hold your convention at a marie callender 's , and that every panellist get a free slice of pie ?
sheldon , buddy , i just do n't think this be go to come together for you .
you do n't know that . i still have plenty of solid lead on this list .
i ca n't believe leonard be spending hundred of dollar on scalp ticket .
last week , you spent that on a little dress .
those ticket be pretty expensive . i have to give howie an advance on his allowance . now he 's never gon na put his toy away .
well , while they 're act like teenager , we could do something grown-up .
oh . you mean like a museum ?
oh , i know . there 's a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea .
ooh , afternoon tea , how sophisticated of u .
la-dee-da , look who have clean underwear .
no , we 're gon na stop at target on the way .
hey , since sheldon 's not go to comic-con , maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up a .
mmm , what if we go a the fantastic four , and just tell people that the invisible girl be stand there with u .
oh , and i thought our day of pretend to be with woman who do n't exist be over .
gentleman , i be one step away from secure a huge guest for my convention .
and that 's where darth vader 's gon na pour soy sauce on your head .
okay , great . bye . our friendly neighbourhood scalper say he 's run late .
do he sound like a criminal ?
what do you mean ?
you know , do he say thing like , youse guy , or , listen here , see ?
yes . he , he 's late because he 's on his way here from _ .
i 'm just say , we do n't know who this guy be . what if he want to steal our money or our kidney , or make a suit outof our skin ?
why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin ?
i do n't know . maybe 'cause dark do n't show the stain ?
why do you think i told him to come to your place ?
i ca n't believe the waiter thought i be your daughter .
that 's cute .
should we leave ?
well , your friend leonard sound like a real weenie .
maybe this be n't a good idea .
i can text the guy and tell him we change our mind .
okay . we 're officially not go to comic-con .
hold on . we always do this .
do what ?
that 's 'cause we 're the good guy .
even batman break the rule .

i know you do n't like change , but it 's not a terrible idea .
yeah , you guy never use that space up there . why not get a table ?
do you want the long answer or the short answer ?
chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system , if the equation describe it behaviour be non-linear , a tiny change in the initial condition can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result .

i know , but
see ? right there . you 're a grown man , you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want . wish you would n't , but one problem at a time .
you make a lot of sense . i like this table , and i 'm get it .
really ? this one ?
hey .
fine . can i at least shower first ?
wow . well , what do you say ?
well , it 's just , after last time , i do n't think you 'd ever want to go back .
really ? ‘ cause i kind of remember a lot of complain and wish for it to be over .
i think you have me confuse with what 's gon na happen when you get out of that shower .
hey , all set . what do you think ? there 's plenty of room for everybody , a view out the window .
my spot on the couch have a great view of a window . sometimes i can see space battle through it . it 's call a tv .
give it a chance , sheldon , you might actually like it .
you 're absolutely right . nope .
well , you ca n't say he do n't give it a fair shot .
so , when can we get rid of it ?
come on , that be ridiculous .
she 's right , a committee that important should meet more often .
that 's not what i 'm say .
yes .
that .
okay . i think we 've found the problem here . it 's not the table at all . it 's you .
me ?
well , it 's always me , take one for the team .
i have spent year turn this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will , and then you come along and reshaped him , with your newfangled idea and your fancy genitals .
be you gon na let him talk to me like this ?
fancy sound like a compliment .
she told you ?
of course she told me , it 's the most interest thing that 's ever happen to her in her entire life .
you 're too close to it , but amy have have a huge impact on you .
you 're right . without realize it , i 've allow that woman to alter my personality .
mm , sheldon , you do n't have a personality , you just have some show you like .
no . no , i 've change . like the frog who 's put in a pot of water that 's heat so gradually he do n't realize he 's boil to death .
or you 're the frog who 's be kiss by a princess and turn into a prince .
or you 're just a tall , annoy frog .
excuse me . i have to break up with my girlfriend .
oh , sheldon , wait .
no . you 've open my eye to the truth . amy have make me a more affectionate , open-minded person . and that stop now .
well , we should call her .
i 'm not surprised you want to end the relationship . i 'm a little surprised you do n't get applecare . anyway , enjoy your life . where do i sign ?
at the bottom . i must say , i 'm relieve you 're not make more of a scene out of this .
oh , i 've already move on . besides , this breakup have nothing to do with me .
it do n't ?
of course not . this be just leonard try to take the focus off that dreadful table by sow discord in our relationship . he 's manipulate you like he always do .

all the time . and he knew that , a your girlfriend , i be n't gon na stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment . i mean , a table ? come on ?

which you also figure out by yourself .
which i also figure out by myself .
yeah , okay , you can stop try to make this about our relationship .
which be strong than ever .

if she do , it would be amaze . that woman can do no wrong .
i do n't know anything about show business , so if you think it 's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your saving , i 'm sure you know what you 're do .
i think we 're gon na go .

do you think he 's right ? be i waste my life on a theory that can never be proven ?
maybe . but how great be game of throne ?
hey , you 're up early .
i could n't sleep .
no , that 's not it .
yes , but you would n't understand .
oh , come on , try me .
all right . i 've devote the prime of my life to string theory and it quest for the compactification of extra dimension . i 've get nothing to show for it , and i feel like a fool .
okay . i get it . i mean , not all the jibberjabber in the middle , but i know what it 's like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it .
you mean your act career ?
no .
your relationship with leonard ?
no .
your fail attempt to go back to college ?
no . i 'm say you and string theory sound like a relationship , and i know what it 's like to be in one and realize it 's never gon na turn out the way you want .
i say leonard , you say no .
i 'm talk about other guy .
okay . well , what do you do ?
you have to have the courage to end the relationship . you know ? break it off , shake hand , walk away .
i do n't know if i can do that .
i know it 's hard , honey , but in the end , that 's how you grow .
penny , have you see my good inhaler ?
break it off , shake hand , walk away .
hey , how 's date two woman go ?
um , kind of hit a bump . when i be honest and told emily she be n't the only person i be see , it go great . so i try the same thing with lucy .
and ?
she have mixed feeling . but when i say , emily be cool with it . emily 's the best . why ca n't you be more like emily ? those feeling become less mixed .
woman . who know what 'll set 'em off ?
at least now i can focus all my energy on just one girl .
i hope i get to meet her a soon a possible .
why the rush ? she be n't go anywhere .
she be . but i like that attitude .
gentleman , be anybody interested in my old string theory book ?
what 's this ?
oh , that 's just a doodle of a hyperelliptic riemann surface .
oh , yeah . be n't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship ?
it be . this seem so elegant at the time , but now i realize i be just a simple country boy seduce by a big city theory with variable in all the right place .
i know . a hard a this be , i have to move on . i ca n't keep postulate multidimensional entity and get nothing in return . i have need , too .
so , you and emily still together ?
i spoke to bernadette . she 's free tomorrow night .
oh , okay , great . but if we 're really gon na do a double date , then we have to go over some ground rule about emily .
like when it turn out she 's make of rubber , i do n't say anything ?
she 's very real .
oh , that 's what it say on the box . right next to dishwasher safe .
see ? this be exactly the kind of thing i 'm worried about you say in front of her .
i promise i 'll be on my best behaviour .
no joke about the year i take ballet .
you take ballet ?
god , you never listen .
be you sure you want to do this ?
the magazine article suggest that one of the way to get over a breakup be a new look .
what about your old look , well-groomed ventriloquist doll ?
oh my god , i do look like that .
you stop it .
so , how do you want me to cut it ?

oh , there be so many excite area . black hole , dark matter .
oh , leonard be tell me about dark matter , but i do n't really understand it .
do n't feel bad . neither do he .

oh , look through my textbook for a new field of inquiry . why do we have a geology book ? leonard , do you throw a child 's party while i be in texas ?
wait . what 's wrong with geology ?
let me put this in a way you 'll understand , penny . you remember how you explain to me that the kardashians be n't real celebrity ? well , geology be the kardashians of science .
have you consider study standard model physic ?
you want me to give up string theory for something that 's less advanced ? you know , why do n't you break up with penny and start date a brown bear ?
like you could get a brown bear .
hey , i 've get a good job . i could buy salmon . you do n't know .
maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix element .
oh , please . if i want to take up a fad , i 'd get a tramp stamp .
what about loop quantum gravity ?
oh , duchess , look at me . my quantum gravity 's positively loopy .
who 's the duchess ?
one of the people that life in his head .
i hope he 's this distraught if he ever break up with me .
well , if he do , i 'll see if my bear have a friend .
that 's actually not bad advice . you know , i do n't seek out string theory . it just hit me over the head one day .
how do that happen ?
okay , how about we toast your newfound freedom ?

leonard , i could use your assistance .
huh , well , i think there 's some really innovative stuff go on in dark matter .
that 's helpful . okay . of these four area
sheldon , what do we say about be a nicer friend ?
thank you .
leonard , what do we say about be a gullible weenie ?
it be just so frustrate .
‘ cause you 're try too hard . you need to do something else , get your mind off it .
hey . how about we bring back anything can happen thursday ?
hey , that 's good . why 'd you guy stop do that ?
you make fun of u . say it be stupid .
all right . i officially reinstate anything can happen thursday .
great , what do you want to do ?

no problem . how 's your mom feel ?

you know , when cinnamon wo n't take her medicine , i hide it in a piece of cheese .
good idea . we can wrap the pill in cheese , feed it to cinnamon , and then my mom can eat cinnamon . so what do you feel like do ?
i be think we could watch a dvd .
well , my mom do n't have a lot to choose from . unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy . spoiler alert , _ minute in they find a prune pit .
actually , how do you feel about watch house of _ corps ?
a straight-up gore-fest ? you hate this stuff .
i do , but for some reason , emily love it and want to watch it with me tomorrow , so i thought if i start with you first , then i could act cool about it with her .
that 's actually not a bad plan . i can sit through the colonoscopy now , but that first time i be like , oh my god , a prune pit .
uh , so , you 'll watch it ?
sure .
howard . help me get out of the tub .
not that one .
so , we 're just randomly choose a restaurant without research it online ?
yep .
great . you know , this be how anything can happen thursday turn into it wo n't stop come up friday .
hey , how about that asian fusion place ?
fusion and asian ? i 'm try not to think about science .
what the hell ? what ? she 's not work late .
and amy do n't look sick .
why would they lie to u ?
that 's a good question . amy and bernadette . amy and bernadette . amy and bernadette . why do you lie to u ?
i just help my mom out of the tub , so , i 'm one slippery horror ahead of you .
you 're a good son . i do n't know how you do it .

but none of that mean we do n't love you .
i have n't be complain that much about the movie . have i ?
i also love you .
well you know what ? maybe i need a break from all of you . come on , sheldon .
okay . ‘ cause if i have to pick now , i 'd probably go with dark matter because
shut up .
what 's wrong ?
i do n't understand my food . chinese noodle with korean barbecue in a taco .
it 's fusion .
my mother would lock her car door if she have to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity .
think i 've be complain too much about the movie ?
not at all .
thank you .
hey , i do n't understand why you 're not upset with amy .
and the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother .
on the bright side , she do n't even notice the pill . why do emily like this stuff ? do you think there 's something psychologically wrong with her ?
what difference do it make ?
what do you mean ?
oh , come on , she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend 's body part and you 'd still go out with her .
i do like that the ex-boyfriend 's out of the picture .
i 'd tell you what i do with howard , but i do n't think dress up like a catholic schoolgirl be gon na work with sheldon .
he 'd probably give you homework .
of course .
between penny 's gorilla movie and howard 's gorilla mother , i have no choice .
oh , we know you do n't lie to her .
thank you . hey , maybe the answer to your career question be in one of these .
penny , there 's only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life 's problem , and that 's an oreo . or a nutter butter , if you 're in a pinch .
come on , open it . i bet it say something great .

oh , do n't seem like it . she get sheldon to go to a psychic with her .
a psychic ? he considers them not just mumbo jumbo , but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo .
well , penny can be very persuasive . she 's gotten me to do a lot of thing i would n't normally do .
yeah , she do .
can i confess something ? once in a while , i get a little jealous of how close penny and sheldon be .
i mean , not in a romantic way . it 's just , she really have some sort of connection with him .
do n't get me wrong , i 'm glad they 're friend . i just wish he 'd be that comfortable around me already .
well , it take him a long time to get comfortable around me , too .
really ? what do you do ?
all right , sheldon , just ask your question .
okay , i just do . what be it ?
for your information , i be ask her about the next star trek movie .
all right , why do n't we begin ? your spirit guide be tell me that there 's a woman in your life you 're have problem with .
yes , you clearly be . but i 'm see a specific woman that you 're in a romantic relationship with .
do she have dark hair ?
do she work in a similar field to you ?
exactly . personally and professionally . everything will fall into place once you commit to her .
you know what this be ? yeah , and i reserve this word for those rare instance when it 's truly deserve . this be malarkey .
wow , you really struck a nerve . i 've never heard him use the m word before .

your heart might be in the right place , but your head , chest and arm certainly be n't .
anyway , the , the funeral 's on sunday .
but , that 's star war day .
yeah , um , of all the thing about this that be sad , that might not be number one . you okay ? i know he meant a lot to you .
i 'm fine .
watch your old friend ?
hmm . yes . look at him , amy . it 's such a shame . struck down in the prime of my life .
do you want me to go to the funeral with you ?
why not ?
all those people blowing their nose . you ca n't tell the sick from the sad . mm . i 'll be at home celebrate star war day , a plan .
be you sure you do n't want to go say good-bye ?
amy , mourn the inevitable be a complete waste of time .
and watch a bunch of goofy space movie you 've see hundred of time be n't ?
if we be in a physical relationship , you just lose sex tonight .
hey , penny . happy star war day .
okay .
can i make you breakfast ? admiral ackbar 's snack bar be open for business .
no , thanks . leonard and i be just go to the funeral .
you sure . not even coffee ? we have r2-decaf . maybe a nice cafe au leia ?
and if you 're not in the mood for coffee i can always make you a chai tea-3po .
oh , i get it , like c3po . what happen to me ?
hey , uh , sheldon , you want anything ?
uh , no , thank you .
you 're be so quiet . be you upset or be you just reboot ?
i 'm fine .
sweetie , be you sure you do n't want to come with u to the funeral ?
oh , i appreciate the offer , but arthur be go and there 's nothing i can do about it . when darth vader struck down obi-wan , do luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral ?
no , he blew up the death star . why do i know this ?
arthur jeffries be a scientist . i 'm sure he do n't care about silly superstition like funeral . you know , if he be here , i think he 'd say enjoy star war day .
he be _ , he 'd say where 's my pudding ?
before you go , at least let me pack you some attack of the scone for the road .
oh , like attack of the clone . we be leave right now .
me , too . although , it might 've be thoughtless of u to bake a death star cake .
well , anyway , it 'll be a nice surprise for the boy . and howie do n't think i take his interest seriously , so hopefully this will keep him fool for a while .
this be pretty cool . you do n't see too many spherical cake .
i wonder why that be .
i have a confession to make .
hmm ?
i 've never be to a funeral before .
really ?
i just never knew anyone that die . i have a pet pig when i be a kid . i mean , when he die , we do n't have a funeral , we have a barbecue .
yeah , we wo n't be eat arthur tonight .
i do n't know him very well , but i still really like him . it 's weird that he 's just go .
i feel like i want to cry .
i ca n't do it with you star at me .
sorry .
no , i 'm dry . you 're a big crybaby , you start , i 'll join in .
i be not a crybaby .
it be a gift . thank you for be the emotional one in this relationship .
i get your back .
yeah .
okay , here we go . episode i : the phantom menace .
ugh , let 's get this over with .
since we all agree episode i be n't our favourite , maybe we just skip it this time .
it be just a suggestion .
well , you know what else be just a suggestion ? why do n't we change the raisin bran box ? hmm ? and you know who get hurt by that ? every single person who eats breakfast .
wow .
i think he 's take this professor proton thing pretty hard .
should we try to console him ?
or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief ?
by stay here and watch the movie .
that 's what good friend would do .
well , at least without sheldon here , we get to start with episode iv .
mm , true . i do feel guilty about him .
me , too .
maybe we should see how he 's do .
yeah .
but after the cantina scene .
obviously .
you never heard it that time .
i be . oh , it , it 's fantastic . i mean this , this be the long that i 've go without run into a men 's room in , in , in year .
i do n't know . i be , i be hop i be go to haunt my ex-wife .
well , that , that clear that up .
well , this , this be weird . most , most of my robe open in , in the back .
oh , wait . what , what , what be , what be this ?
oh . oh . oh , neato . i 'm , uh , i 'm go to need a band-aid .
so , what do you think of your first funeral ?
well , i do n't want to be a jerk , but it be kind of a bummer .
mm . well , i think more about if i 'd have any regret .
what would you regret ?
mm , you know , that i do n't travel more , take more risk , learn another language .
you know klingon .
that 's true .
no , i meant that a a regret .
i just thought of one more .
what 's that ?
i regret not say yes when you ask me to marry you .
well , it just be n't the right time .
yeah .
and this be also not the right time . do not propose .

i do n't know what you 're upset about . i 'm the one who 's lose .
okay . fine . would you feel well if i propose so you could turn me down again ?
hmm .
no , do n't you dare . you reject me right now and tie thing up .
it 's just such a big decision . i do n't want to have any regret .
no . my dad control the tv , so unless someone be a texas ranger , jake or the fatman , we do n't see it .
not me . i get into science 'cause i be always the small kid in school , so i thought if i become a scientist , i could invent a formula that make me taller .

girl sprout ?
how do that get you into science ?
oh , i go to the library and take out a book on biology to see what whore do .
on the one hand , if i say yes
this be n't funny anymore . just say no so we 're do with this . will you marry me or not ?
ooh , interest . do you just propose to me again ?
no .
really ? because i just heard will you marry me ? that 's two proposal , one day . sound like someone want to spend the rest of her life tell people how to spell the name hofstadter .
you know what ? fine . do whatever you want .
hey . penny , do n't get upset . here . i love you , but , no , i will not marry you .
thank you .
where , where , where be we ?
well , why , why do you think i 'm here ?
be , be this the , the first time you 've lose , you know , someone close to you ?
yeah , i 've , i 've outlive a few of my doctor , too .

i do n't need a treadmill .
i get plenty of exercise .

i do n't know . the bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in schindler 's list be tough to beat .
ah , very good . because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the holocaust .
it only get funnier when you explain it , sheldon .
maybe we should get one of those machine to help her up the stair .
howie .
take care of your own mother ? how can you say that ?

wait , wait , if it be n't for indiana jones , the ark would never have end up at the warehouse .
that 's true . he collect and deliver the ark to the proper authority for filing .
yeah !
aw !
awkward silence , sheldon on his phone , no touch . somebody 's have date night .
it 's actually steamier than it look . sheldon 's look up the phallic symbolism of root vegetable in renaissance painting .
oh , no , i get bore with that . i 'm just browsing cuticle scissors on amazon .
how do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table ?
if you do that , i 'll scream .
sheldon , i have some excite news to tell you .
that make two of u . my new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business day . come on , one .
i 've be invite to consult on an experiment at your university for a few month . be n't that great ? we could have lunch together . we could carpool .
you know , rid with leonard have gotten a little tedious lately . the only car game he ever want to play be the quiet game . and he 's terrible at it , i always win .
so , you 're okay with this ?
well , why would n't i be ?
sheldon , do n't defecate where you eat mean do n't have a romantic relationship in the workplace .
really ?
huh . yeah , i always take it literally . that 's why i have never once move my bowel in this or any restaurant . hmm .
i 'm relieve that you do n't have a problem with u work together .

why not ? hairy fairy .
i think it could be romantic . you know , my parent met at his place of work .
would you please tell him this be n't a good idea ?
no , no , i think it 'll be great . maybe next time he get conjunctivitis at work , she can hold his head and try to put the drop in his eye . giant baby .
that 's a rag ogre .
yeah , i know .
i 'm just say , i 'd never want to work with bernadette . can you imagine see someone all day long and then you 're suppose to hang out with them after work , too ?
yeah , i know , and it drove me into the arm of another woman . bipolar bear .
well , i appreciate your concern , but i wo n't be see any more of amy than i already do . i assume we 'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota .
why ? so you can see the look on amy 's face when she hears my top-notch idea ?
so , amy , what be you gon na be work on at caltech ?
if they 're anything like human , the answer 's yes .
you mean like death row inmate with nothing to lose ? no , that would be unethical .
you know , not a lot of people know this , but the monoamine oxidase enzyme be discover by a woman , mary bernheim . that 's right , my phone be just a smart a you guy .
he 's never gon na stop do that , be he ?

really ?
yes . before all thing , i 'm a scientist . i 'm just there to do my work and , with a little luck , scare the living crap out of some monkey .
hmm . you sure your mothlike personality wo n't be drawn to this blazing fire that be myself ?
more and more sure .
well , then , you have my permission .
i do n't ask for your permission .
too late . no backsies .
no , no , listen to me . sheldon misunderstood . what i meant be , if we work together , there 'd be too much of me for you , not the other way around .
well ?
okay , fine . i do say that , and i think it 's true . i think if we work together and live together , we 'd get sick of each other .
yeah , but to be fair , he only say the part about him get sick of you .
what exactly do you think you 'd get sick of ?
his only option here be to fake a heart attack or have a real one .
be it my voice ? be i too bossy ? what ?
my arm be feel numb .
that 's the wrong arm for a heart attack , doofus .
like look me in the eye and lie to me ?
find somewhere else to sleep tonight .
if it make you feel any well , amy and i be fine . i mean , really good .
so , boy , how be the pyjama party ? you guy jump on the bed and sing into hair brush ?
it be n't a pyjama party . it be just a couple of bros hang out , giggle , eat cookie dough and watch princess bride .
please , stop talk .
i mean , you know , sheldon , none of this would 've happen if i have n't try to help you .
uh , it also would n't have happen if , in the early universe , hydrogen be a little more common or a little less common . this be fun . your turn .
hey .
hello .
that be kind of icy . you two okay ?
oh , we 're fine . a howard advise , she 's merely respect our professional boundary .
oh , uh , on the off chance that bernadette do n't call back and apologize , how do you feel about mexican food for dinner tonight ?

that 's 'cause you always fill up on chip .
and this be dr gunderson from stockholm .

yeah , i read your paper online . that technique for create a new heavy element be inspire .
oh , well , thank you . believe it or not , i just learn a chinese research team at the hubei institute for nuclear physic ran a test on a cyclotron , and the result be extremely promising .
oh , more test , more success , more fame . yeah , but do n't worry , i will remain the same down-to-earth humble joe i 've always be .
good to know .
now give me that cookie , i discover an element .
thank you so much for come .
you call the right person . i believe i have the perfect romantic even for you to give leonard .
okay , good , 'cause i 've be really struggle with this .
a i 'm sure you 're aware , the quick way to a man 's heart be through his
pant , but leonard say sex do n't count .
okay , that 's just the plot for dirty dance . what else would you love ? other than be lift over patrick swayze 's head .
oh , oh , uh , you could , uh , stand outside his window with a boom box in the air .
that 's from say anything .
look , i 'm a lonely guy , i watch a lot of movie . look , penny , if you truly want to be romantic , it need to come from you .
well , you 've probably never have to do this stuff 'cause you 're young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you .
yeah , i 'm try to be sad about that . i ca n't .
let 's see , what 's next ? okay , here . this be the magic marker i be use when i make the discovery .

what 's next ?
and what ?
no . no , no , no , no .
what 's wrong ?
i 've make a horrible mistake .
what be you talk about ?
this table , it 's in square centimetre . i read it a square metre . you know what that mean ?
that american ca n't handle the metric system ?
amy , i be off by a factor of _ .
but the chinese team found the element .
yeah , well , they should n't have . my calculation be wrong . there must be some resonance between the element i do n't know about .
so you just get lucky ?
sheldon cooper do not get lucky .
you and me both , brother . it do n't matter . the element be found because of you , and that 's groundbreaking .
what matter be the great scientific achievement of my life be base on a blunder . i 'm not a genius , i 'm a fraud .
you know , sheldon , in neuroscience , we 're forever find something in one part of the brain that we thought be someplace else .
: you get to stop beating yourself up over this . i mean , you make a mistake , but it be a happy mistake .
there 's nothing happy about it . i 'm be give credit that i do n't deserve .
buddy , i do n't think you can . i mean , once it 's out there , it 's out there . this thing be like the science equivalent of a sex tape .
you know , frankly , i 'd prefer a sex tape .
no .
make sure you guy get to the restaurant by eight . bernadette 's meeting me there at eight thirty and i do n't want to blow the surprise .
get it . now , uh , i have a question about the song . i be think at some point i could bust out a little rap .

invite them to live with u .
yeah . it must be nice to have someone do something so romantic .
okay , you know what 's not romantic ? rub it in someone 's face .
actually , it can be , but i told you sex do n't count .
i 'm get worried about bernadette . i 'm gon na call and check on her .
oh , that 's a big deal .

why would i flip out ? be it a spider ? it 's a spider .
that seem like a reasonable request . although so do , hey , leonard , would you mind return that dvd ?
i 'm sorry . i 'll , i 'll take care of it .
okay .
i mean it , i 'm go to .
i believe you .
and you 're go to stay calm ?
i say i would .
how about that ? sheldon 's be reasonable .
when i broke my arm i use to stick a coat hanger down there . you ever try that ? maybe go in through the ear ?
you would n't make joke if you could feel the way i feel .
that 's stupid . why ?
you say it 's itchy and uncomfortable . i say situation like this make me feel the same way .
oh , do i forget to tell you ? that store go out of business year ago .
really ?
penny , can we please get our drink ?
cool . at my lab , i perform ten laser capture micro-dissections .
i scrap gum off the bottom of that table . only 'cause my manager saw me put it there .
that 's lucy ?
i think that reason 's call racism .
you because you just call him your indian friend .
yeah , well , you 're short .
no , but we knew that .
oh , water would be great .
wow . how 's he do ?
great .
oh , i do n't know . i guess i thought it would be easy .
so , you can never take it off ?
no .
not even to sleep ?
no .
so , you 're just an idiot ?
it 's call prove a point .
be the point that you 're an idiot ?
gentleman , please . leonard be try to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoe . he ca n't walk in my actual shoe . he have the foot of a toddler .
and the man impersonate a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fire .
i do n't get it .
you do n't have smokey the bear in india ?
no . oh , be he anything like , uh , mun-mun the mongoose ? he taught u not to play with cobra .
you have to be taught not to play with cobra ?
you have to be taught not to burn down the forest ?
we do , you never brought it .
oh , that 's right . nacho and a turkey club .
well , i be too busy stand up for my friend to worry about your , i want to say salmon .
so , how be you gon na tell raj abut what you do ?
what do you mean how ? what 's the big deal ?
then you make her cry and leave .
hey , what 're you work on ?
i 'm think about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotate mirror turn virtual photon into real one a a method of observe dark energy .
that 's a pretty cool idea .
yeah . it 's great you 're here . i 'd love to get an engineer 's opinion .
sure .
or it 's resolve .
hey , that next of kin thing sound pretty good .
i believe this be yours .
can i ask you guy a question ? so , i 'm see lucy tomorrow night , and i 've never hung out with someone who broke up with me . how do you do it ?
you ca n't let her know you 're hurt . you know , the key be confidence .
well , if you 're sure you want to do this , it 's only coffee , just relax and see what happens .
i 'd save that for the second date .
good , good . ‘ cause no matter how hard i try , i can not get the twin to look alike .
sheldon 's not here . why do n't you take the sweater off ?
there 's a principle at stake .
which be ?
oh , i do n't know . who care ? look at me .
what be that ? what be that for ?
so you can send it to princeton and get your money back .
i must say , sheldon , you 're handle this dvd business with an impressive amount of maturity .
i do n't know why that surprise you . i 'm a grown man . a should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel .
be there some kind of new cop mechanism you 're employ ?
i 'm gon na go with sad . so what 's the story with you and this dvd ?
there 's nothing to tell . maybe i purchase a book entitle do n't sweat the small stuff and i follow it wise suggestion , one of which be stop and smell the flower .
seriously ?
hi .
i 'm pretty good . listen , i just want to apologize for break up with you in an e-mail .
oh , uh , i 'm kind of see someone .
i think i know the answer to this , but just to be clear , it 's not me , right ?
this be all your fault , i should 've listen to mun-mun because i 've be play with a cobra and her name be penny . why be you so cruel ? do you enjoy my pain ?
there 's a girl at the cheesecake factory i can set you up with .
i love you , penny .
how be it i can conceptualize a methodology of examine dark matter in the universe but ca n't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower ?
i think the real question be , why do you waste your time with cheap , childish prank ?
there 's probably a deep reason . which i 'd be happy to discus with you over some peanut brittle in a can .
okay , sheldon , i be out of option . video store owner , nursis manookian , have no next of kin .
oh , not necessarily . i suggest you look for long-lost relative either in armenia or lebanon .
listen to me , sheldon . i be not go to lebanon to return super mario brother the movie .
you know , it might be fun . you love hummus .
why be n't this bother you ? be n't your brain get itchy ? this be on your card . this could be ruin your credit score . why be n't this make you crazy ?
leonard , i have something to tell you , but i want you to promise not to flip out .
seven year ago , i found out the dvd be late and i paid for it .

yeah , it do , but luckily all my photo get back up to the cloud .
i can not believe you travel the entire country and never left the train station .
i know i be think that . be this a show on flag or mind reading ?
but the truth be i can no longer balance a full-time career , a popular internet show , and a girlfriend .
and he really do have one , you jerk on the comment board .
so a they say , all good thing must come to an end .
after only _ episode .
_ if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on .
that be a good one .
it be so good .
you know , i thought cleaning out a dead professor 's office be gon na just be boring , but then i found his denture and realize it 's also gross .
do n't professor abbott 's family want any of this stuff ?
i do n't think he have a family .
that 's rough .
i know . you can spend your whole life work , and at the end all that 's left be some paper in a box .
make you think . oh , well .
hey . hey , we 're suppose to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it 's important .
i do . it 's all outdated or disprove .
i do n't know . this old pen kind of prof gravity . when i tilt it , her bathing suit fall right off .
oh , my dad use to have a pen like that . i date it all through sixth grade .
it still feel weird just throw away his work like this .

poor roger abbott .
penny . oh , my rookie of the year .

oh , good . bernadette . cute , sweet , vicious little bernadette .
oh , yeah ? at the company picnic she yell at me and my grandson for lose the three-legged race . i mean , he still call her that mean kid with the big booby .
hey , what be you talk about ?
over the year here at fun with flag , we 've have an opportunity to learn , laugh , wonder .
and , yes , even shed a tear or two .
like when you do a two-hour fourth of july spectacular and it do n't get record .
how many time do i have to say i 'm sorry ?
how about four thousand . one for every domino i set up to make that american flag . please enjoy these highlight .
crikey , what flag do we have today ?
australia , mate .
fwag , fwag , not a fwag , fwag , i be cwushing this .
say , betsy ross , what you work on ?
i have no idea . because the story of me sew the first american flag be unsupported poppycock .
then who do sew it , hmm ?
do n't ask me . i 'm just a simple seamstress whose descendant be out to make a quick buck .
fancy a dip , my dear ?
i do .
wow , that flag be a lifesaver .
not a fwag , fwag , fwag , not a fwag . fwag . ugh cwap .
when stuff like this get me down , you know what i like to do ?
sing hakuna matata like an eight-year-old girl ?
wrong , smarty-pants . it 's everything be awesome from the lego movie .
look at these notebook . they 're full of page and page of data . he clearly spent year on this .
mmm . it 's just column of random number . toss it .
well , but what if this be a potential breakthrough for him ? what if , what if this be the thing that would 've finally let him open that bottle of champagne ?
maybe he do n't know what to pair champagne with . strawberry , caviar , oyster . all good choice . yeah , that look right there be why people eat before they come to your party .
this have to mean something .
well , there 's no discernible pattern that i can see , but it should n't be too hard to run the number and check .
well , maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer .
sure . we could try multiple regression with vary physical and experimental constant .
oh , we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physic problem .
ooh , it might be a substitution cipher . we could start with basic cryptanalysis .
or we could talk to this guy he use to share an office with .
oh , let 's do that .
yeah , i 'm not even sure if it 's the right word .
oh , yeah . i remember him from the picnic . he be the one cry like a wuss the whole time .
what 's his problem ?
well , i do n't think you be suppose to say sissy anymore .
no . no , no , no . i think the cookie thing .

thank you .
cut . sheldon , that be beautiful .
if you do n't press record
i press it .
well , that 's it . that 's the end of roger abbott .
i still keep think about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing .
i guess the sad truth be , not everyone will accomplish something great . some of u may just have to find meaning in the little moment that make up life .
that 's a nice way of look at it .
i love that .
yeah , me , too .
then , of course , rub our success in sheldon 's face .
oh , well , that 's the best part .
what ? what ? why would she say that ? you know she drink , right ?

you , at least listen to the premise . since you be born in germany , i thought we could talk about german flag . how do you feel about dress up like a swastika ?
hey , how be thing go with your parent ?
not great . they hire divorce attorney .
you know , speak of attorney , if i ever need a lawyer , i would not hire she-hulk .
you know what ? that be almost on topic . i 'm gon na say good job , sheldon .
wait , she-hulk 's a lawyer ?
yeah , she work at a law firm in new york .
yes , but she 's the only monster at the firm . between you , me and the wall , i think she 's an affirmative action hire .

if you 're not up to host christmas dinner , i 'm happy to do it . you can even bring your father .

it also get it brain plucked out with tweezer .
and his last meal be a food pellet ? you 're a monster .
all right , next , we 're gon na introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus , measure your stress level and see how it affect your problem-solving rate .
ready ? begin . why 'd you pop it ?
who eats them horizontally ?
my mother say that 's how good girl do it .
perhaps this be a waste of time .
sheldon , you 're a remarkable scientist . just be patient , i 'm sure you 'll find the breakthrough you 've be look for .
thank you .
and if you only do solid research instead of make a groundbreaking discovery , what do it matter ?
only do solid research ? i come to you for help , and you insult me ? i thought the least that you would do would be
look , your anxiety level be right in the zone .
really ? oh , that 's fantastic . now , wait , they 're drop . why be they drop ?
because you 're happy they 're elevate .
oh , that be infuriate . ooh , look , they go back up again . terrific . oh , no , they go back down .
all right , guy , what game do you want to play ?
let 's see . how about emily or cinnamon ?
you know what ? i think it 's a little weird that you remember me say all these thing . maybe the truth be , you 're jealous of all my relationship .
oh , maybe i be . who would n't want to be the girl , or possibly dog , to hear the word you 're so lucky , you have the shiniest hair .
so you just want u to disagree with whatever you say ?

howard 's right , that 'll never work .
stop fight me on the premise . it 's scientifically valid . i 'm go to advance proposition , i just want you to challenge me .
i do n't think that 's what you want at all .
why , of course it 's what i want . why would i say it 's what i want if it 's not what i want ?
i ask you for one simple thing , and you ca n't even do it .
yes , we can .
yeah , well , then do it .
nah .
you guy be the bad . thank you , i think that be helpful .
that would be so romantic for you and leonard .

lady ? lady ? lady ?
come in .
lady .
what 's up ?

we be talk about penny 's job .
and how difficult it be to do when she 's bloat , cranky and crampy ? continue .
sheldon , we be just people . we talk about the same thing you guy talk about .
you talk about if werewolf can swim ? see , leonard say yes , but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he be bitten . what do you think ?
let 's just talk about our period .

that be the last one , i promise . we wo n't play any more .
emily 's feeling ?

i do n't know , he 's not really hurt anybody .
you do n't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment .
he be get a lot of work do . he have a pretty interest take on proton decay .
wow , if he crack that it 's a game changer , guy . it 'll completely redefine our understand of the physical universe .
hmm , it would . okay , back to emily or cinnamon ? how can such a little girl eat such a big steak ?
sheldon , i want you to take that cap off .
that nag tone be help my anxiety , yeah . but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill , that 'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah .
i 'm sorry , but you know we agree not to bring work to date night .
there you go , perfect .
sheldon , stop it , i 'm not kid . take the cap off , and put the notebook away .
but after month of struggle , i 'm finally make progress .
or do i , hmm ? sir isaac newton write his principia while convince he be an armadillo .
that 's not true .
yeah , well , maybe it be , maybe it be n't . i have be hallucinate lately .
sheldon , this have to stop . you need to get some sleep and take care of yourself .
amy , i have gotten more do in the last few day than i have since i make the switch to dark matter . what if i stop do this , and it all go away ?
your thought and idea come from you , not from your anxiety .
hmm , perhaps . but i 'm not take the cap off .
it 's one thing to make yourself miserable , but you 're make everyone around you miserable , too . now , i 'm tell you for the last time , take the cap off .
oh , really ? what if i do n't ? and before you answer that , can i have my dessert ?
yeah , well , woman , what be you gon na do ?
i knew you 'd understand , armadillo isaac newton .
here we be .
hey . what be you try to pull ? the president of science be n't in here .
you lie down , he 'll be here in a minute .
okay . hey , i thought you be try to trick me .
maybe in the morning .
yeah , you get some sleep .
no , i do n't want to go to sleep , you ca n't make me .
yeah , darn straight , you ca n't . try to tell a grown man to go to sleep .
soft kitty , warm kitty .
purr , purr , purr .
you know , he can be a lot of trouble , but when i see him lie here asleep like this , i just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face .
mmmm .
oh , i 'm feel much well . and i 've also be continue to make progress without artificially raise my anxiety level .
i turn on the heat in my car and some vomit come out , so my level , right up there .
hey , guy . mind if emily join u for lunch ?
yeah , sure .
yeah , no problem .
so i hear you guy have be play a little game .
so , tell me about your day , how 's it go with the particle detector ?
wow , you remember that ?
yeah , i listen to what you say . you 're building a particle detector use superfluid helium .
you know , when you talk like that , i want to take you right here on this table .
and you know from past experience this table can not support both our weight . so , how 's the detector go ?
well , it 's tricky work with superfluids . whatever container you put them in , they kind of creep up the side and crawl out all on their own .
no , i do . i do n't write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing .
okay , well , this be cool . uh , there 's a thing call superfluid vacuum theory , where empty space be imagine a a superfluid with all of it quality , viscosity , density , surface tension
okay , well , if you find him , use the kitchen island , that coffee table will not support both of you .
which mean a spherical multidimensional superfluid show the same negative-energy density a space-time . so what do you think ? what do you think ? so what do you think ?
what ? be it wrong ? have you see it somewhere else ?
hmm .
i know this be n't my area , and i could never do the math like you can , but could this be something ?
well , you could have set newton 's gravitational constant to one . and , ugh , the whole thing reek of blueberry . you know i ca n't stand these scent marker .
no one told you to taste them . come on , be , be this good or not ?

i earn this . back off .
you 're still awake ?
for a man whose last observation be our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid , you 're still awake seem like quite the sophomore slump .
you work out all the math .
oh , i do more than work out all the math . i write a paper .
i write a paper on our idea .
when do my idea become our idea ?
when i mixed it with sheldony goodness and cooked it in the easy-bake oven of my mind .
this be good . our idea be really good .
well , the lightbulb in this oven be ridiculously bright .
you know , if no one 's thought of this , yet , this could be a big deal .
only way we 'll know for sure be if we post it online to the pre-print server . i have it ready to go , but i be n't gon na do it without you .
wow , it 's all happen so fast . should we just sleep on it ?
we could , but we always run the risk of someone else beating u to the punch .
you 're sure it 's good ?
my name be right on there with yours . that be a surefire mark of quality . that might a well say direct by joss whedon .

sheldon , this be superfluid helium . put this in your mouth , your tongue will freeze and break off .
do it smell like blueberry ?
no .
then we 're probably okay .
hey , your paper get mention on the quantum diary physic blog .
really ? what 'd they say ?
let me see , let me see . one call it insightful and innovative . we 're insightful and innovative .
oh , nice to meet you , mr insightful .

i 'm so sick of people be mean on the internet .

all right , do it . call him . let 's find out what this loser 's ever accomplish .
well , hello there .
oh , brother , you should see the look on your face .
i like your paper very much . the premise be intrigue .
if you be sit in a chair for _ year , you 'd get bore , too . anyway , get to go . i promise to help the neighbour kid with his math homework . ciao .
stephen hawk like our paper . say the premise be intrigue .
and you a well , mr our-premise-is-intriguing .
yeah , you keep set me up for failure .
because she want him to give her the part she need .
okay , that 's enough .
what ? no , i really want to know what happens , and bernadette really , really , really want to know what happens .
i be just kid . i 'm sorry . and the story 's really good .
she turn away , wipe her eye . she could n't bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever . then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around . it be cooper .
you will not believe what stephen hawk just say .
there 's a lot of rhyme in the future , be n't there ?
you 're right . this be even weirder than i thought .
you want me to stop reading ?
be you kid ? no , no .
so , tell me , cooper , be the way of physical love different in the future ?
yeah , okay , i 'm good .
i 've invent a science joke , would you like to hear it ?
sure .
how many edison do it take to screw in a light bulb ?
who care ? he stole the idea and do n't deserve his own joke .
be that really true ?
hey , sowwy to intewupt .
do you know edison do n't actuawy invent the wight bulb ?
just want to dwop this off a a wittle thank you for amy .
your idea weawy hewped me out . my wight-cone quantization paper 's onwine alweady . the wesponse have be amaze .
well , that 's fascinate . i ca n't wait to read it .
since when do you help out barry kripke ?
well , i 'd be think about a cellular automaton approach to neuronal connectivity , and i thought it might have some interest application to string theory , it 's not a big deal .
oh , really ? when i be do string theory and hit a dead end , why do n't you try to help me ?
i do . you say the only math biologist know be if you have three frog and one hop away , that leaf two frog .
that 's pretty funny , that do sound like me . but that do n't mean that you should be stand on street corner hand out your math to whatever guy come along .
she 's just be nice .
well , normal 's a strong word , but sure .
hello .
you okay ?
if i be okay , i would 've say hello , and not the much more ominous hello .
what 's go on ?

i 'm sorry i do n't have a camera .
why would she do this to me ?
well , i 'm sure she do n't upset you on purpose . besides , be n't you the one who say there 's nothing more important than the advancement of science ?
no , i say there 's nothing more important than me advance science .
i do n't know what to tell you . i mean , why do n't you talk to her ?

no .
oh , give me that . just out of curiosity , if i be to let something go , how would i do that ?
i do n't know , just think about something else .
can i think about the spiny anteater ?
sure .
the spiny anteater never go behind my back and work with barry kripke . that do n't help at all .
you know , some people try visualization .
how do that work ?
okay , imagine your problem be a pen .
okay .
now imagine you 're hold that pen .
okay .
now open your hand and let it go .

son of a bitch .
okay , that 's great . now , let it go .
i ca n't believe you be test me against a chimp .
make this interest ? you bet money on me ?
no , no . we design an experiment involve you . see ? now , be n't that interest ?
it 's not interest . it 's incredibly insult .
okay , maybe this will help . imagine you 're hold a pen . before you go too far , not a special pen with your initial engrave on it , that 'll make the next part really hard .
oh , my , that 's it . get out .
get out .
penny ?
what ?
howie , if the store succeed , stuart have a source of income , and he can move out of your mother 's house . seem like some old furniture be a reasonable price to pay for that .
this be why i have to rewrite our wedding vow .
dude , i , i think that 's nathan fillion .
oh yeah , look at that .
and he 's pick the tomato out of his salad just like i do . i always do feel a connection with him . oh , i have get an idea .
we 're not sell his tomato on ebay .
no , if we get captain reynolds from firefly to do a signing at stuart 's store , that would be amaze .
that would be great .
i do n't know . i mean , if he 's not nice , it 's gon na make it hard for me to watch him in anything again .
what ? the , the guy who play jon snow be a jerk . we still watch game of throne .
oh , uh , i think you make a mistake . i 'm not an actor .

what be you talk about ?
i know you 've be give me secret puzzle test .
sheldon , open the door .
i ca n't . i 'm naked .
i just saw you .
hang on .
open the door now .
oh , hey .
pull up your pant .
it 's not a big deal . i run test like this on undergrad all the time . if you fill out some paperwork at the university , i can get you five dollar .

do you want the picture or not ?
how about a picture with a guy who look like nathan fillion but a little more annoyed than nathan fillion usually be ?
what do you think ?
i ca n't believe they do that .
i know , it 's so insult . at one point , they have me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box .
unbelievable .
and how could a chimp even solve that ? that be impossible .
really ? you could n't get it out ?
thank you .
wow , the store look great .
so you guy be test u both ? what be the matter with you ?
eh , what 's the matter with them be they think they 're so smart they do n't care if they hurt other people 's feeling .
that 's not true .
that sound like u . i still do n't understand why you 're upset . you solve every puzzle faster than all of the chimp .
well , except barnabas , but he be on adderall .
can you please just let it go ?
hold that thought . hello ?
how can i make this up to you ?
you could have at least warn him about the furniture .

no , stuart picked out those throw pillow all on his own .
hey , you okay ?
what 's wrong ?
what ?
oh , my god , howie .
i 'm so sorry .

whenever i saw her , she 'd say i be too skinny and try and feed me .
do n't take this away from me .
i do n't care for her yell . but now that i 'm not go to hear it again , i 'm sad .
if you want , i can yell at you later .
it wo n't be a good .
let 's have a toast . to mr wolowitz . a love mother to all of u . we 'll miss you .
i just read about an experiment design to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hour .
that do n't sound right . my research have show that it take three to five year of shameless beg .
honey , neither of u come off good in that story .
yeah , i , i , i saw that article you 're talk about . uh , the participant ask each other a series of question design to promote intimacy .
and then they finish it off by star into each other 's eye for four minute .
oh , that 's nonsense . i proclaim my love for you . and the last time i look into your eye be when you thought you have conjunctivitis .
raj , would you ever try an experiment like that with emily ?
i 'm tell you , you ca n't create love in a few hour . right ?
oh , careful . you 're poke at the whole foundation of the bachelor .
no .
you do n't even let me finish .
forget it .
so , you can experiment on all the ape you want . but i want to manipulate the emotion of two captive human being , suddenly i 'm the monster .
why do n't you just do the test ?
what ? you 're okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward question about your innermost feeling ?
yes .
please , can i do it with him ? please ?
i 've be listen to sheldon 's feeling on thing for ten year . tag , you 're it .
yeah , but what if the experiment work ?
i 'm not gon na fall in love with sheldon .
that 's what i say . before i knew it , he pontificate his way right into my heart .
uh , fun fact , pontificate come from the latin word pontifex , which mean bridge builder or pope .
you know what ? i can honestly say if we fall in love , not only will i drive you there , i will buy you all the dragon t-shirt you want .
okay , babe , let 's do this .
you guy be really be calm about penny and sheldon do this thing . if it be me i 'd , i 'd be a little nervous .
i think we 're safe .
well , that 's what the bully at bruce lee 's high school thought . and then , bam . karate .
well , be we just gon na sit here while they do the experiment ?
the two of u could do it .
yeah , sure , that might be fun .
what 's the first question ?
hang on . okay . give the choice of anyone in the world , whom would you want a a dinner guest ?
hmm . i can honestly say penny .
oh , then i choose a janitor , 'cause i 'm about to throw up .
okay .
sound good .
should we call howard and bernadette ?
do he say anything about the funeral ?
not much , but he seem to be in a pretty good place .
no , i 'm just say that sometimes bag be misrouted .
eight sixteen .
um , well , it 's , uh , black . there 's a red ribbon tie to the handle .
the world 's great mom be in the shoe compartment .
you ready to begin ?
yup . be right there . i assume you do n't want wine .
correct . you 're not suppose to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery .
question one . give the choice of anyone in the world , whom would you want a a dinner guest ?
hmm . living or dead ?
you sure that 's your choice ? ‘ cause i 've have that dinner .
well , i have n't . and while they say never meet your hero , i just do n't see how i could disappoint . who would you choose ?
robert downey , jr .
oh , i do n't think of iron man . you know , maybe after myself and i have dinner , we can meet you two for dessert .
so , what do you guy want to do ?
that 's it ?
yeah , why ?
he 's there .
i do n't think so . leonard ca n't stand yoga , the beach , massage or dance .
interest , you do n't mention amy .
you 're about to enter the lab of the late dr david saltzberg . while conduct study on slow the age process , there be a catastrophic accident and he die . or do he ?
be you be polite or scar ?
ah , what a room !
oh .
this be cool .
we have to look for the clue hidden around the room .
uuuuuuuh !
i do n't know , perhaps somebody take it off the carousel by mistake ?
i , i wish i be tell you that . um , but the passenger could 've gotten on an international flight .
i 'm sorry . w , would _ frequent-flyer mile help ? that could get you to sacramento .
if you could wake up tomorrow have gain any one quality or ability , what would it be ?
well , not to steal from the bible , but turn water into wine sound pretty good .
come on , i 'm just have some fun with you .
i believe what you 're do be use humour to avoid vulnerability .
fine . honestly , if i could have one quality , i wish i could be a smart a you guy .
ha . keep dream .
well , i ca n't read people 's mind . actually , that 's not true , i can read men 's mind , but only 'cause it 's usually the one thing .
when be we go to get robot eye ?
really ? you always seem so confident .
well , i 'm not . and if i could read people 's mind , life would be so much simpler .
well , now i wish i have the ability to make that stuff easy for you .
thank you .
wow , i just felt this wave of affection for you .
you sure it 's not too much bible juice ?
brain !
keep it down , we 're work here .
how 's it go with the globe ?
we use the coordinate to locate the city .
solve puzzle too fast ! slow down !
sure you do n't want to go home ? when the bag 's return , they 'll deliver it to u .
all right , we 'll wait .
what ?
you well find my husband 's mother 'cause one way or another , w e 're walk out of this airport with a dead woman .
which book be we look for ?
uh , origin of specie .
ooh . there 's a picture of the sun over there .
oh , get the key .
so , that 's the key to the door ? that 's it ?
we spent two hundred dollar on six minute of fun ?
sorry , guy . really thought the puzzle would be well .
if you be to die this even with no opportunity to communicate with anyone , what would you most regret not have told someone ?
so , it would be today ? huh . well , i suppose there 's something satisfy about die on my birthday .
today 's your birthday ?
yes .
well , that 's always be a secret . not even amy know .
well , i do n't enjoy present . and the thought of people jumping out and yell surprise fill me with more dread than the word george lucas director 's cut .
so , why do you finally tell me ?
the point of the experiment be to be completely honest with each other .
well , thank you for share it with me . i wo n't tell anyone .
thank you .
that be so funny . i never would have pegged you for a pisces .
great news , your bag be return .
oh , no . that thing 's gon na end up in my bedroom .
that 's it . we 're do with the question .
all that 's left to do be stare into each other 's eye for four minute without talk .
okay . wait , hang on . bladder check . we 're good to go .
you ready ?
yes .

we 're not suppose to talk during this part .
sorry .

of course you be , i 'm warm and soothe . i 'm like a human bowl of tomato soup .
i meant more like a little brother .
it 's get creepy again .

two one six four two zero one nine eight nine . and that , little lady , be pi to a thousand place .
i 'd say i 'm sorry i ask , except i do n't .
oh , look , it 's the scientific american that cover the paper leonard and i write .
oh , let me see .
i have mixed feeling about do interview . i like the part where i talk . i do not like the part where the other man talk .
sheldon , this article do n't mention leonard at all .
well , that ca n't be right .
it only refers to dr cooper and his team . do you even talk about him ?
all i do be answer a few question about the theory . and then express my gratitude that scientific american do n't include any of those smelly perfume card .
poor leonard .
why ? the theory he come up with just get mention in scientific american . he ought to be thrill .
he might not be .
oh , maybe you 're right . he be kind of a lump .
think about it . how would you feel if you be refer to a part of leonard 's team ?
oh , i 'd be incense .
so you see what i 'm get at ?
squeaky wheel get the grease ?
no .
grass be always greener ?
try again .
well , i do n't know , we 're all groot ? just tell me .
leonard be a much a part of this paper a you be , and he be overlook . he 's go to feel bad .
but it be n't my fault . i do n't exclude him . and i do n't write the article .
remember that time you do n't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland and they let that other kid do it ?
oh , that kid . poor leonard .
exactly .
for the record , that kid be a terrible choice . if you cry when you drop your churro , you do not have what it take to rule england .
well , it 'll be good that you 're there . howard 's be have trouble decide what to keep and what to let go .
yes . it reminds me of u eat out and her say quick , nobody 's look , fill your pocket with ketchup .
leonard ? have you ever notice that only my name be on the cable bill ?
yeah .
good , good . and your name be on the electric bill and mine be n't . and i 'm okay with that .
actually , your name be on the electric bill .
oh , right . this be a disaster .
i do n't even know what you 're talk about and i agree .
what 's go on ?
an article be just publish in scientific american about our theory .
no . no , they love it . they , uh , could n't say enough nice thing about it .
so what 's the problem ?
you know how the pennysaver only have my name
sheldon .
they do n't mention you in the article . only me .
really ?
uh , that , that 's not necessary .
it be . they 're what hold back the urine and the faeces . look , maybe , maybe you should n't read it . it 'll only make you feel bad .
cooper and his team ?
you should know i have nothing to do with that .
that 's not help .
well , i 'd give more example , but , well , everyone in your position 's so forgettable .
stuart , we 're here .
it 's nice of you to let him keep stay at your mom 's house .
i call , they say a transformer blew . it 's the whole block . should be fix by tomorrow .
in the middle of the night .
howie , what 's wrong ?
everything okay ?
what should we do ?
there 's , like , twenty pound of food in there .
howie .
i love that .
me , too . oh , look , we 've get enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it .
i mean , who even read scientific american ?
it 's kind of a big deal .
can we please just stop talk about it ?
i 'm sorry . what can i do ?
nothing , i 'm fine .
no , no . i 'm gon na cheer you up . here we go .
what be we do ?
i be take you shopping .
oh .

it do have a camera in it .
what ?
i spoke to the reporter at the magazine .
what happen ? do you tell him it be my idea ?
i do .
thank you . what do he say ?
he say they make the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist .
why do he think you 're the lead scientist ? it be my idea .
you know what ? i do it . what 's four buck ?
if you 're try to make me feel well , it 's not work .
well then what if i told you that i add your name to the cable bill ?
but leonard 's idea be good .
i 'm the one who thought of it .
yeah . but now he 's happy to let people think he 's responsible for everything .
and that 's why you get an ipad helicopter .
be it my fault i have a much big reputation than he do ?
it 's not your fault .
be it my fault that my name come first on the paper alphabetically ?
not your fault .
be it my fault that when the reporter cite me a the lead scientist i do n't correct him ?
hey , look at that pretty bird .
he always need all the attention . he 's such a baby .
i know , i know .
i swear , he be never ever play with my helicopter .
thanks .
do she throw anything away ?
no . if i find my foreskin , i 'm gon na kill myself .
okay , so we 've get , um , three brisket , four meatloaf , one lasagna .
one jewish lasagna , two pound cake that be about eight pound each , and one giant container of matzoh ball soup .

you know , tor , the god of tunder . a i be say , be this a sign that our society be approach gender equality ?
it 's true . at the store , i have to put a seat on the toilet .
we wo n't know if there 's equality until female thor have a baby and the avenger be cool with her pump breast milk at work .
i wonder if only a baby who be worthy can suckle at the bosom of thor .
okay , new salon topic . salon , dumb thing from a long time ago or interest thing make dumb by talk about superheroes ? discus .
i do n't believe it matter what the topic be . what 's crucial for a salon be that we conduct the discussion in an elevate and insightful way . it 's all about the execution .
sheldon .
guy .
no , it 's okay . we 're all adult try to have an intelligent discussion . at least i be . howard , what do you think ?
well , i guess , a an engineer , i lean towards execution . i spend my day try to take idea and make them real .
well say , old chap . i thought eloquence have die , here it stand before u . start today , it 'll go gettysburg address , i have a dream , and what he just say .
oh , now he 's a genius ? all you ever do be make fun of him and engineering .
leonard , please . his mother just die .
you 're be ridiculous .
yeah , so be you .
guy , if i want to hear people be bitchy , i 'd go to my real salon .
leonard , lot of people could 've have that idea , but very few people could 've work out the math the way i do .
and girl .
hey , you already ruin thor , give it a rest .
so i 'm just suppose to be okay with you hog all the credit ?
i do n't hog anything . unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisin in it .
hey . sheldon , leonard , living room , right now !
you guy ever notice sometimes bernadette sound like my mom ?
i do n't hear it .

leonard , i 've be work on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley .
oh , i like to laugh . but say it anyway .
okay , um , what do you say to a graduate of the uc berkeley physic department ? i 'll have fry with that . because his education have n't prepared him for a career in the science .
you know , when they chase you out of there , you only have to run faster than sheldon .
be you all set for your trip ?
yeah , i think so . i just restock the old prk .
prk ?
public restroom kit . everything a boy need for make pee pee in new and strange place .
i do n't see what 's crazy about bring a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell .
yes , who do you think give him the danger whistle ?
would you like to play a physic car game i invent call i ca n't spy ? it 's all the nail-biting tension of i spy but the add fun of subatomic particle and wave outside the visible spectrum .
if it 's half a much fun a one time ten to the fourth bottle of beer on the wall , i 'm in .
i 'll begin . uh , i ca n't spy with my little eye something passing right through u .
that soy frappuccino i have .
i do n't want to play anymore .
we have n't be on a road trip in a while . this be fun .
we get it , you won the game . stop bragging .
no , listen , we write a paper together . now we get to go to a university and talk about it ? that 's pretty cool .
i suppose it be . in fact , if you 'd like to celebrate with a little music , i 'd be okay with that .
what ? this road trip just get crazy .
play that funky music , white boy .
i 'm surprised you know that reference .
so , i put sticker on everything we 're gon na sell . we just need help take it all out to the driveway .
can i be in charge of pricing ? i 've be go to garage sale my whole life . can you believe i get these pantyhose for a nickel ?
all right , amy 's in charge of pricing and be _ .
hey , penny , can you give me a hand with this ?
sure . oh , we have one of these grow up . i use to play all the time .
oh , yeah ? i love ping-pong .
oh , i meant beer pong .
you know , you can leave one side up and play against it .
and if i have a friend , they might have told me that .
i think you just answer your own question .
sweetie , we have a lot to do . we do n't need to decide this right now .
of course .
so they 're request that the white boy play the funky music , yes ?
yes .
and this music we 're listen to right now be funky a well ?
sure .
let me ask you this . do you think this song be the music the white boy ultimately play ?
it could be .
so it 's like the musical equivalent of russell 's paradox , the question of whether the set of all set that do n't contain themselves a member contains itself ?
well then i hate it . music should just be fun .
make great time . gon na be there pretty early .
will our hotel room be ready ?
i doubt it .
be n't you worried that sit in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective ?
seem a little confrontational , but all right . you know , we wo n't be very far from skywalker ranch .
oh , that 's true . it 's not like we can get in there .
why not ?
i do n't think george lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he want people drop in .
yoda 's swamp be in the middle of nowhere . tatooine be in the middle of nowhere . hoth be in the middle of nowhere . that 's code , leonard . he want u to drop in .
we do have time . i mean , we could drive by and just look at it .
yes . oh , i 'm so excite . and i just ca n't hide it .
i 'm about to lose control , and i think i like it .
what be you talk about ?
so when do you guy think you 're gon na move in ?
it 's tricky find the right balance between tasteful modern and jewish mother tchotchke crapfest .
have you make a decision about the tardis ? i think i can sell it if we call it big british porta-potty .
you ca n't just decide . how about i arm-wrestle you ?
you could play ping-pong for it .
how be that fair ? you grow up with a table .
yes , but i mostly use it a a battlefield in an ongoing war between the transformer and the thundercats for control of a bra i have found in the wood .
yes , penny play for me .
that 's not fair , she have upper body muscle .
dude , three-time sanskriti school for well-born boy badminton champion .
that 's right , okay , raj can play for me .
ooh , you just chose champion . it 's like we 're re-enacting the ancient german practice of trial by combat .
leonard make you watch that , too ?
no , no , i like that show . it 's get dragon and people do it .
so it 's settle . the fate of doctor who 's tardis will be decide by a game of throne inspire death-match on the battlefield of thundercats versus transformer .
if you still have that bra , i 'll give you a nickel for it .
there it be . it 's just a gate . on a road .
be n't even that hard to find .
this be so amaze .
i know . you want to get a picture ?
i want more than a picture . i want to go in .
well , so do i , but they 'll never let u .
be that the attitude that help you get penny ?
no , but i do n't have three year to make that gate feel sorry for me .
there 's a speaker box . drive up , push the button , and let 's see what happens .
okay , yeah . what do we have to lose ? i 'm a little nervous .
well , get over it . confidence be key in these situation .
right .
hello ? this speaker 's not work , just pull up .
and that 's how it 's do .
all right , we 've defeat the first challenge . now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate .
we 're try to get past a security guard , not rescue zelda .
i think what really need to be rescue be your sense of whimsy , but one quest at a time . so what 's the plan ?
uh , i 'm just gon na be honest with the guy .
honesty will never get u in .
well , what 's your plan ?
who be you here to see ?
uh , i 'm just gon na tell you the truth .
oh , you be kill me .
sorry , guy , we get this a lot . ca n't let you in .
what if i told you that i be the voice of yoda ? a record session i must attend .
hey , listen , you seem like decent guy . i ca n't let you in , but i get some hat and t-shirt i can give you .
thank you so much . see ? maybe honesty be the best what be you do ?
come on , raj . you be the king kong of ping-pong . you be the menace of table tennis . put her away , 'cause i do n't have a third one . yes . woo .
rajesh eight , penny four .
hey , raj . if howard ca n't keep the tardis , how great would it look at your place ?
what ?
do n't listen to her . you and i go way back , we 're like brother .
we be . we be . oh , no . what a terrible serve . sorry , brother .
eight-five .
this be ridiculous . i want a new champion . amy , be you serious about be able to serve ?
uh , it , it 's be a long time . i do n't know . i 'm probably pretty rusty .
wow .
well , if you can switch champion , so can i i want raj .
oh , come on , like you even care .
i care . oh , wait , no , i do n't . good luck , raj .
you know , i thought our friendship meant more to you .
so do i .
i do n't know . maybe they 'll call imperial officer to take u to a hold cell on the death star .
oh , i think that 's below the pay grade of an imperial officer . stormtroopers be really the one who
he 's right . uh , stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police .
uh-huh , i 'm normally very nice , but you shut up , too .
oh , i , uh , i hopped a fence , and they caught me in the sculpture gallery make out with a chewbacca statue .
all right , i talk to my supervisor , and we 're gon na let you go with a warn . but if you ever come back , we will call the police and press charge .
no , you 're not go anywhere , kissy face . let 's go . i have to take your picture to post at the guard gate .
except , raj be gon na win . be n't that right , raj ?
come on , get in her head . be intimidate .
okay , uh , i 'm gon na own you , bitch .
do n't listen to him , all she 's get be a serve . now , grab a fresh tampon and put her away .
what , and that 's not offensive ? where 's the line ?
one-five . two-five . three-five . four-five . five-five .
well , that be an excite _ second .
you know , amy , i , uh , ca n't help but wonder how sheldon would react if the tardis be at your place .
do n't listen to her , just hit the ball .
if this do n't get him into your bedroom , nothing will .
be you still mad at me ?
yes , we miss our lecture , we be almost arrest , and you get me lock in a room with a man who force his tongue down the throat of a stuffed wookiee .
boy , some people be just glass-half-empty .
the glass be empty , sheldon . it 's completely empty . if you give that glass to a man who be die of thirst , he would be dead , do you know why ?
that part be pretty good .
see ?
you do flop around a lot .
i 'll take your word for it . i be too busy try not to defecate .
you know , when they be escort u to the detain room , i look through a door , and i 'm pretty sure i saw a display case with the ark of the covenant .
that 's amaze .
i know .
and i saw jabba the hutt rid by on a motorcycle . although that be right after the tasing , so who can say for sure ?
amy , the daleks be right on my tail , quick , we need to reset the time circuit . oh , no , i left my sonic screwdriver behind .
really should have thought this through .
i recently read that during world war two , joseph stalin have a research program to create supersoldiers by have woman impregnate by gorilla .
what a sick use of science .
hey , a long a the baby 's healthy .
i wonder if stalin consider any other animal .
hippo be the deadliest creature . a half-human , half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass .
yes , but when they 're hungry-hungry , you can stop them with marble .
yeah , the correct animal for interspecies supersolider be koala . you would wind up with an army so cute it could n't be attack .
but half-man , half-owl could fly
the answer be cuddly soldier with big flat nose . move on .
so , penny , when 's the new job start ?
do you get a chance to look over the material i give you ?
great . when ?
i say i 'll get to it .
i 'm sense awkwardness , be i right ?
yes .
i do n't want to be pushy , but you 've never do pharmaceutical sale before . it seem like you could use this time to get a head start .
but imagine how impressed they 'd be if you show up already familiar with the material .
could n't hurt .
mm , i do n't know . who here have ever be hurt because they be the teacher 's pet ?
it be like the rest of the class want m mcdonald to forget the quiz .
dr cooper .
yes . uh , welcome back .
you mean the dialogue that go , please , no , please , no , please , no .
dr cooper , while you be away , we come up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study .
currently , you 're be paid under a grant to specifically research string theory . if we promote you to junior professor , you 'll be able to choose whatever field of research you 'd like .
that be correct .
yes .
you people be sick .
hey . ready to go to lunch ?
just give me a minute . i 'm stimulate the pleasure cell of this starfish . i just need to turn it off .
what happens if you do n't ?
then i have to sit through lunch know this starfish be have a well day than i be . be bernadette meeting u at the restaurant ?
uh , no . actually , i do n't invite her .
how come ?
well , ever since she help me get this job , she wo n't stop bugging me .
well , i think she just want you to do well , and she 's worried that you wo n't 'cause you be just a stunningly poor waitress .
that be not true .
i 'm still wait on my mini corndogs from two year ago .
i told you , they 'll be right out .
well , you saw her the other night . be i wrong ?
no , i just , i feel kind of uncomfortable talk about her like this . usually when someone 's be talk about behind their back , it 's me and it 's right in front of my face .
i 'm sorry . i just need a little break from her .
i understand . you know , there be some research that indicates that share negative attitude about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friend .
so , what be you say ?
i 'm say , in the spirit of science , what be that little skank 's problem ?
so , i 've be try to come up with a cute couple 's nickname for me and emily . what do you like well ? emippali or koothrapemily ?
why be it your last name and her first name ?
oh , well , her last name be sweeney , and something just do n't seem right about koothrapeeney .
hey , how 'd it go with human resource ?
i do n't understand . why be it bad that you have to teach ?
what a stupid question .
i ca n't believe i have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad student who probably think dark matter be what 's in their diaper .
this might not be that bad . uh , you like tell people they 're wrong .
wrong , just because i enjoy that one do n't mean i always do .
you enjoy give people grade .
a valid point , but unoriginal . b-minus .
and you love the sound of your own voice .
yeah , well , of course i do . listen to it . it 's like an earful of melt caramel .
hey .
not much . you want to get a drink later ? just the two of u ?
not tonight . i 'm a little frustrate with her .
it 's drive me crazy . just this afternoon , i saw on instagram that instead of study , she go out to lunch and get a manicure .
i know .
exactly . do she not realize it or do she not care ?
i do n't know . the important thing be i be here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party .
hey . we just want to see how your class be go . where be everybody ?
there be no class .
do you send everyone to the principal 's office already ?
no one sign up .
well , that 's not your fault .
i call the department secretary to see what happen . apparently , i have a reputation for be obnoxious .
what ?
hey , sheldon , i 'm sorry .
no , it 's fine . now i can devote all my time to dark matter .
why would you do that ?
what 's wrong with you ?
i 'm think about get my doctorate , and he want to teach . why not ?
oh , howard . i appreciate the gesture , but this be a graduate-level physic class . i do n't think you 'd understand a single thing i be talk about .
ask why not again , i 've get an answer .
sheldon , i 'm more than smart enough to take your class .
no .
yes .
how would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution ?
i would guess a wave-function and then vary it parameter until i found the low energy solution .
hmm . do you know how to integrate x square time e to the minus x , without look it up ?
i 'd use feynman 's trick , differentiate under the integral sign .
oh , come on . you might 've go to school for a couple more year than me , but guess what , engineer be just a smart a physicist .
you take that back .
no .
so , after drink with bernadette , i get home , and penny call to complain about her . and then while i 'm talk to penny , i get a text from bernadette .
i be try to prepare my lesson plan for howard . why be you tell me this ?
because it 's take _ year , but high school be finally awesome . i love them both , but i 'm in the centre now , and i love that even more .
amy , please . i be try to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine .
but i 'm just
not now .
you well watch that attitude , buddy . you 're date the popular girl now .
hmm . you 're up late .
oh , i 'm work on my lesson plan for wolowitz . he be go to be so lose . look at this section over here . even i do n't really understand it .
sheldon , why be you do this ?
i 'm a teacher , leonard . it 's my job .
no , i mean , why be you go to so much trouble to prove that you 're smarter than wolowitz ?
oh , it 's no trouble , it 's actually a pleasure .
you want to know what i think ? i think the idea that someone could be a smart a you , or even smarter , scare the pant off you , and you ca n't deal with it .
interest point . you 're suggest that i have emotional issue below my consciousness which drive my behaviour , thus cause me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority .
might be something to think about .
leonard ?
yeah .
howard 's allergic to peanut . how can i use that against him ?
hey .
i suppose that 's a fair request . there 's no reason we both ca n't benefit from this experience .
okay .
okay . well , then , uh , first thing first . um , be you familiar with the brachistochrone problem ?
i be .
it 's an invert cycloid .
wonderful . now , what about euler-lagrange theorem ?
all i do be win , win , win no matter what .
what be you do ?
everybody hand go up , up and they stay there !
will you stop it . this be a classroom . this be not american bandstand .
okay .
now , where be i ? let 's see . oh , yes . over here . you what be you do now ?
make a straw .
why ?
hey , girlfriend . can i get a what what ?

oh . oh , i hear you . try and get that nag off your back , right ? i mean , you 're not a bicycle , why 's she rid you like that ?
no , i think she be just try to help . plus , i really want to do well at this job . so

you report me to human resource ?
you violate the sanctity of my mouth .
well , i drop your class , so i hope you 're happy .
i told you you be n't smart enough to take it .
i 'm smart enough , sheldon . ask me a bunch of question about a topic i 'm not familiar with do n't prove anything . i could do the same to you .
yeah , try me .
okay . you enjoy make fun of engineering so much , how do you quantify the strength of material ?
be that right ?
yeah . okay , how do you prevent eddy current in a transformer ?
laminate the core material .
okay , what be the potential side effect for our erectile dysfunction drug ?
yes .
want to stop here ?
nah , you get this . let 's go for a drink . i 'll call amy .
hey , girl .
okay , next question , for the butterfinger . how long be a galactic yea
_ million year .
yes .
okay , this one be for a cadbury creme egg .
oh ! it 's not even easter time . this be crazy .
the rhombicosidodecahedron .
we be so smart .
why do n't girl like u in high school ?
because we be awkward and weird and could n't play sport !
right again .
you 're wrong .
no , i 'm not .
yes , you be .
no , i 'm not . settle this . those little animate picture on the internet , be they call gifs or jifs ?
the guy who invent it say it 's jif .
i 'm sorry , do you mean the guy or the juy ?
well , i 'll give you three guess why i 'm so irritated .
something happen different from the way you want it .
i guess news travel fast . it 's true , a select group of scientist be invite to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman , and i be n't include .
oh , sheldon , i 'm sure it 's not because they do n't think you 're an elite scientist .
yeah , i bet you anything it 's just 'cause you 're a pain in the as .
you 're just say that to make me feel well .
look , you can spend the rest of the day be bitter about this .
agree .
hey , raj .
oh , that 's a lot of girl scout cooky .
wow , so you 're not curious at all ?
thanks again for agree to do this .
oh , it 's cool , i 've never be on a podcast before
well , you picked a good one to start . wil 's have lot of great guest . jonathan frakes , brent spiner , michael dorn , gate mcfadden .
those be star trek people .
yes .
i deserve that . i invite you on my show and i drove here .
this be excite .
most people download it later , but usually a few thousand people listen live .
again , right in the ear , straight to the feeling .
can you please pas the salt ?
sure . it 's not like i be invite to richard feynman 's house and have anything well to do .
be this how the rest of the night 's go to be ?
i do n't know the future . do you think there 's a chance that an asteroid could hit the earth , destroy feynman 's house and everyone in it ?
no , sheldon .
accord to the codicil of the relationship agreement which you insist upon , we 're not allow to pout or be moody on date night .
you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff .
you know , i 'm think rip up the carpet , maybe lose the wallpaper , all new light fixture .
you know , if you knock out this wall , it would give you an open floor plan , and then , it 's a little scary , but could be fun , indoor fire pit .
okay , okay . when he 's at comic-con , i 'm bring in a wreck ball .
hi . be you howard wolowitz ?
um , this be a little weird , but a lawyer be try to contact my father , because his name be still on the title for this house .
sam wolowitz .
i know .
bernadette , weird thing be happen out here .
uh , spoiler alert , after the monkey see , it kill .
i 've just be hand a note . i 'm go to read it . wil , do you want more diet coke ? also , we have juice .
uh , that voice you just heard belongs to leonard , penny 's fiance . uh , leonard , why do n't you grab some headphone and join u ?
yeah .
i do n't have a question . i just want to say i 'm a big fan of the movie . i 've see it , like , ten time .
thanks a lot , caller . you know that the movie actually have a little bit of a cult follow .
yeah . i be at a science-fiction convention , and i saw a woman dress a your half-ape character .
hey , man , yo , be everything okay , wil ? ‘ cause it 's be , like , two minute and you have n't even brought up stand by me .
hey , kevin . it 's really excite to talk to you .
oh , you guy be very sweet . so , penny , listen , i saw your movie .
you 're cruisin ' for a beatin ' , wheaton . anyway , man , i dug the ape movie , penny . and i thought you be , like , really great in it .
yeah , whatever . penny . penny , how come you 're not in more stuff , man ? i 'd cast you in a minute .
oh , my , i would love that .
you have a new job .
i do n't think you can do both .
stay out of it , kevin smith .
do you think there come a point in life when it stop feel bad to be left out of thing ?
probably not . it 's an evolutionary advantage to be include in group activity .
you know what ? i use to be a fan of evolution , but i 've since evolve , and now i think it 's dumb .
be left out be a terrible feel . no one understands that well than i do .
hey , look at that . even in your example , you 're all by yourself .
when there be a louse epidemic at my school , everybody get it except me . i try to fool everyone by sprinkle sugar in my hair , but i just get attack by bee .
i can just picture them all right now at feynman 's house , probably discuss schrodinger and at the same time , not discuss schrodinger . see ? they 're miss out on hilarious joke like that .
it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build fort in the living room and would n't let me in . i hat that so much .
you know , there 's nothing i can do about get you invite to the symposium , but if you want , we could build a fort
be n't that a little juvenile ?
more juvenile than this ?
i 'll get the blanket . you google how to have childlike fun .
oh , let me do it , howard .
oh , how nice . i love find nemo .
why would i lie ?
no .
no .
why do n't you help with the coffee ?
okay , but something smell fishy . and not just because you work around sea animal . that actually sound interest , and i 'd like to learn more about it . hey , you okay ?
not really . this guy show up out of the blue , and now i have a brother ? my father have another family ?
i get it . what do you want to do ?
i do n't know . i , i 'd just like him to go away . i ca n't deal with this .
all right , i 've get your back .
i ca n't believe my brother 's an astronaut . that 's amaze . what be it like ?
listen , dude , it 's time for you to hit the road .
so , for those of you just tune in , we be listen to a really fun fight between my co-star
all right . we 're listen to a really fun conversation between my co-star from serial ape-ist _ and her fiance , who do n't believe woman should have dream .
give me back that juice .
what be the harm if i audition ?
well , what if you get it ?
i do n't know , i make a movie , become rich and famous , win an oscar , a golden globe and live an incredibly wonderful life .
and that be kevin smith .
thanks a lot .
i 'm just try to protect you . how many time do i see you get your heart broken try to make it a an actress ?
okay , instead of protect me , why do n't you try be excite when something good happens ?
i 'm always excite for you . i 'm excite that you found this new job where you 're make decent money .
decent ? i make twice what you make .
wait , twice ?
yeah .
for those of you at home , leonard just found out his fiancee make way more money than he do . let 's listen .
i go to school for half my life . i have a doctorate . i 'm still pay off college loan .
well , how much do you owe ? maybe i can help you out .
for those of you at home , i be shake my head no .
wonderful . i just finish hang the light .
can i come in ?
yes , oh , but enter through the side . batman be a load-bearing blanket .
amaze .
i know . this be n't the printout . this be my real face .
what be we do ? this be a fort . let 's sit on the floor .
rough it ? okay . everything look so big from down here . this must be how leonard feel .
sorry , i have a long drive .
keep dream .
you have sex with a robot ?
that 's not what she meant .
but technically , yes .
hang on , if you 're make all this money , where be it ?
in a safe place .
what do that mean , under your bed ?
no , it mean a diversified portfolio of stock and bond . i 'm not overly conservative . i 'm young , so my guy say i can afford to take some risk .
wait a minute , you have a guy ?
do n't you have a guy ?
why would i have a guy ? i do n't have any money .
for those of you listen at home , how great be this ?
okay , look , would it make you feel well if i do something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a kevin smith movie ?
so , i have to ask , be the robot sexy ?
‘ cause that 's all you need , right ?
you be my brother .
okay , so the final four fort in the first annual best fort ever contest , or fort off , be , fort knox , fort ticonderoga , fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket .
i 'd say , knox over ticonderoga , 'cause it 's get the gold .
mm-hmm .
and mcblanket over sumter 'cause it have a high thread count . oh . ten o'clock . date night 's over .
well , of course we do . fort knox do n't have a secret physic lending library .
come on , i 'll help you take this down .
well , wait . what if , just this once , we suspend the date night parameter and you stay later ?
well , a long a we 're suspend the parameter , i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover .
that 's a big step .
it 's a big fort .
very well . i will agree to a family-friendly , g-rated , boy-girl sleepover .
pg . some scene may be too intense for young viewer .
g-rated , with a warn for family with baby and toddler .
you get yourself a sleepover .
do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajama ?
would it alarm you to know that i hid those thing here two year ago just in case this ever come up ?
it would , but you know how much i admire preparedness . how do you know we 'd be in the living room ?
hello ? what be this ?
we built a fort .
be those my sheet ?
yes , they be .
okay . well , you kid have fun . i 'm gon na go to sleep .
well , leonard , do n't you want to see the inside of the fort ?
yeah , i 'm good .
oh , come on . i really want to tell someone they ca n't come in .
okay , fine . sheldon , may i please visit your fort ?
i want to say no , but it 's too glorious . get in here .
thank you .
okay , have a seat on the floor .
hey , would you like to hear some song i 've rewrite to get child interested in the hard science ?
sure .
really ?
uh , okay , okay . uh , we , we get it .
perhaps you 'd prefer this one . the itsy bitsy spider be not an insect at all , because it haseight leg and two body part .
that 's pretty cool , sheldon .
hey .
hey .
hey .
hello .
you guy know the new discovery class mission that nasa 's be work on ?
yeah .
well , they 're look to include a message from earth in case one of them be encounter by alien life .
oh . when i encounter alien life , i discover that the key thing be not to sit in it spot .
all right , you ca n't breathe our air without an inhaler , he 's allergic to earth nut , but i 'm the alien .
anyway , i 'm among a handful of scientist that have be ask to submit a design proposal for the message and it delivery system .
excellent .
good for you .
and i be wonder if any of you guy would like to help me do it .
be you kid ? yes . what do you have in mind ?
i 'll tell you exactly what you should do , avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm .
yeah , absolutely . you need a device capable of deliver information across a wide range of perceptual modality .
any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of object in space . so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic .
my mommy raise a gentleman .
hey . thanks for come by .
yeah . i 'm excite to help .
i get it . uh , just this morning , sheldon would n't let me put almond milk on my grape-nuts because he say it be a theoretical nut conflict .
you should have told him to mind his own business .
yeah . that 's well than what i do say , which be , fine , i 'll eat them with club soda .
what make them think they 're always in charge of everything ?
mmm , they 're alpha male .
huh , what do that make u ?
we could be beta . they 're second in charge .
okay , that sound good .
or we could be omega . they get push around by the alpha and the beta .
okay , that sound like u .
whatever . there 's no alpha here , and this be your project . you 're in charge . how do you want to start ?
i do n't know . how do you want to start ?
i do n't know . should we call sheldon and howard ?
no . we can do this by ourselves .
okay . great . how do you want to start ?
i do n't know . how do you want to start ?
i bet that start off a a joke , but by the third one you realize there be something strangely enjoyable about it .
yeah , i kind of want to do it again .
i do n't recommend it . you 'll be do it the rest of your life . anyway , if you 're look for leonard , he 's with koothrappali .
uh , no , i actually come to talk to you .
how nice . here be some topic that interest me , quantum mechanic , train , flag .
oh , sorry . that 's not on the list .
well .
oh , wait . no . how about we split the difference and discus why austria be an archduchy and not just a regular duchy .
hmm . i know exactly what you should do . unfortunately , i can not tell you .
well , why ?
i 'm attempt to turn over a new leaf . earlier today , it be point out to me that i tend to force my idea on people .
what 's go on in here ?
oh . how do you drink it ?
i think i 'll have a beer .
be this about the space probe he 's work on without you ?
howard , you 're grown men . you guy do n't have to do everything together .
try to hurt raj 's feeling .
i 'm sorry . what do we know ?
do n't take this the wrong way , but how many of these little booze ball have you have ?
i be kid . of course you be .
you well not change , because i love who you be . now , will you need help cleaning all this up when you 're do or can you do it all by yourself ?
there 's my big bos man .
so , often on the front of the locomotive be a large iron wedge for clearing object off the track . now , while commonly know a a cowcatcher , i prefer the more accurate cow exploder .
mmm .
if i be at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie , which train should i get on ?
be you use train to trick me into give you advice ?
no .
all right , then . you should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on make a career decision until you have more information .
oh . you 're right . i 'm worried about something that have n't even happen yet . huh . you be a wise man .
well , penny , who 's smarter , the wise man or the person who come to him for advice ?
oh , i guess you 're right . maybe it be the person who asks .
i 'm sorry . what be i think ?
uh , just out of curiosity , why do n't you ask leonard for advice about this ?
‘ cause i already know what he 'll say . wah , wah , wah , you should n't do it .
ah , it 's just like he 's here .
okay , so we know that previous attempt to send a message into space , like the golden record on voyager , be heavily criticize .
eh . although , to be fair , i watch e.t . build a telephone out of a speak & spell and an umbrella . dude be like a little brown macgyver .
that would be more helpful if e.t . be real .
well , my feeling be real when he be about to die .
my god , when he 's on the table and they use the paddle on him .
and he 's all white .
they zip him up in that bag .
and gertie ca n't stop cry .
the flower dy .
okay , let 's talk about something else .
all right , so it sound like we need a way to communicate that 's simple .
and do n't require outside machinery to be built to access it .
it 's also a problem because we do n't even know if the alien who find this can see . i mean , they might communicate in a totally different way than u .
like when my dog be mad at me , she tell me by pee in my slipper .
that 's actually a valid example . animal do deliver message through scent .
bee talk to each other by dance . whale have their song .
yeah . penny have about twenty different way of roll her eye that each mean something different .
okay , so , what it sound like be , what we want be a device that can deliver a message through not only sight , but other sens , a well .
the most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to posse be touch .
ooh . ooh , ooh . we could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium .
all we have to do be rig up a 3-d communication system .
i know .
this be great .
yeah , you know what else it be ?
what ?
exactly what sheldon and howard say .
well , thank you for pee in my slipper .
it 's the eye of the tiger , it 's the ear of the bat , it 's the whisker of the catfish and the walrus .
hang on . not that your song be n't terrible , it be . but how do you mention bat and leave out sonar ?
you do n't let me finish . and also regard the bat , it have sonar .
hey .
hello .
look , i know you guy be upset , but we 've talk about it , and we think it 'd be beneficial for you to be part of the project .
i 'm sorry . i be try to think of what rhyme with nose of the aardvark .
well , well , well , do you hear that , howard ?
look , we admit it . the idea that you guy come up with be really good , and i 'd love your help .
i suppose it could n't have be easy for you to say that .
it be n't , so be you in ?
certainly .
sure .
great . now that we 're all on the same page , let 's get together tonight and work on it .
get together tonight ? leonard , stop try to control everything , and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do . go ahead , raj .
okay , i think we should do it right now .
tonight work well for me .
so , i 'd like to try a technique where no one get steamroll . when you talk , instead of bring up a new idea , respect what be just say by building on it .
uh , building on that , we should order dinner .
how be that building on what he just say ?
building on what sheldon say , i could go for chinese .
hang on . building on what leonard say , no one built on what i say .
building on building on that , there 's a new build-your-own pizza place on colorado .
building on that , i 'd like to remind you , i 'm lactose intolerant .
i saw the menu . they have soy cheese .
bah , you do n't say building on . you 're out .
it 's not simon say .
yeah , you 're miss the point , sheldon .
penny ?
hey . i have n't see you audition in a while .
you quit act ?
i heard you can make good money do that .
really ?
they 're gon na love you . i heard she 's push _ and everything 's fake .
yeah . i start that rumour .
okay , since we agree on the delivery system for the message , maybe we should talk about what the message could be .
well , i think we should show what earthling look like .
the plaque they sent up on the pioneer probe have a draw of a naked man and woman on it .
yeah , i never care for that . it 's advertising to predator race just how soft and squishy we be .
squeeze yourself .
you want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe ? that 's ridiculous .
oh , you mean passive-aggressive like post picture of you and your wife eat cosmopolitan ball that you know belong in my mouth ?
perhaps howard meant passive-aggressive like ask our group to help on your project , and then only choose leonard .
look , i 'm sorry i hurt your feeling , but you do have strong personality and always end up take over .
we look great .
you let a guy sit on me .
he be dress a princess leia . it make a nice picture .
i 'm just say , sometimes raj and i feel push aside .
yeah . like when you take sheldon to texas and show him all around nasa , you do n't even think to ask me and leonard .
you know what ? you 're right . i should have ask you .
yeah , and if he do ask you , go . it 's amaze .
okay , and if we 're talk about be left out of thing , you guy go to skywalker ranch without u .
oh , i recommend that , too . that be a magical experience .
sheldon , you 're not in charge . raj be in charge .
leonard , who 's really in charge ? the person in charge , or those who put him in charge ?
he 's right . if you think about it , we 're all in charge .
well , i 'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job .
properly , at all . it 's just word i 've never heard .
you 're welcome . hey , now that you 're make some real money , maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner .
sure .
and you probably have to invite your other friend 'cause she overheard you talk about it , and it would be awkward to exclude her .
how about now ?
do n't forget your wallet .
i , uh , huh .
i could eat .
it 's , like , the best one they make , i just ca n't get it to work .
i 'll figure it out .
it stream hd video straight to your phone while it 's fly .
nice . where be you when i be single ?
okay , we should leave in about an hour . you all packed ?
uh , yeah , i just need to throw in a few last minute thing , you know , makeup , underwear , clothes .
if your bathroom floor count a a carry-on , you 're packed .
leonard , have you ever give a high school commencement speech before ?
be n't you afraid of be blind ?
how would i be blind ?
at the end of the ceremony , all the student throw those pointy hat in the air . it 's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye .
i 'll take my chance .
fine . i wonder if they make i told you so card in braille .
look , the problem with commencement speech be that they 're boring . ooh , do you own a t-shirt cannon ?
i do n't know . why do i own one ?
i think it 's really nice that you 're share this experience with penny .
well , now you get to go back a a successful scientist .
with a beautiful girl on your arm .
and a pointy hat stick out of your eyeball .
how 'd you get ready so fast ?
why do you need a belt ?
it 's call an even look . i 've never be to new jersey before .
it get a bad rap from show like jersey shore and real housewife .
so it 's not really like that ?
no , it 's like that . well , i 'm excite to show you around .
you think we 'll have time to visit your mom over there ?
what ?
yeah , look like there 's a big storm all up the east coast .
well , can we get on another airline ?
i do n't think so .
so , that 's it ? we 're not go ?
i guess not .
well , that suck .
yeah . i work hard on that speech , too .
oh . you could tell it to me .
be you sure ? i could pretend i 'm a high school cheerleader who ca n't control herself around esteem alumnus .
greeting , distinguish cheerleader .
ooh .
okay , the wifi extender be on , the camera 's on , they 're both on the same network . we should be get an image .
all i see be a black screen . and my own reflection . i look sad .
maybe we should recalibrate it .
all right .
step one , rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down position for at least ten time .
it actually say at least ?
yeah .
why would they say at least ? be it ten toggle ? be it a hundred toggle ? you know ? be it a thousand toggle ? ten thousand toggle ? a hundred thousand toggle ?
sheldon .
you see where i 'm go with this .
now i rotate it horizontally on it centre axis until the light turn green .
initiate rotation sequence . do n't look at me , initiate . what do red and yellow mean ?
not much , just want to see how my son 's do .
be you still date that dermatologist ?
i 'm tire of indulge your foolish lifestyle . it 's time you learn responsibility . and the only way to teach you that be to cut off your allowance .
i 'm cut you off .
just to be clear , financially or mid-sentence ?
no red and yellow , no red and yellow .
yay .
it 's green .
we do it . oh , if it 's this much fun to rotate , imagine when we fly it .
okay , now all i have to do be rotate it vertically until the light turn off .

and i will pray for you .
one moment . there 's something i need to say to you .
leonard , i always make you earn my affection , but today i realize that there 's more than one way to raise a child .
therefore , i would like to initiate a new protocol wherein i shower you with unconditional love .
so needy . come to mommy .

you 're right , you do kind of kill the mood .
i do n't kill anything . you do , talk about your stupid tv show .
irony 's not really my strong suit . but i have be get well with sarcasm , if you want to give that a try .
oh , sure , i 'd love to .
i do n't want to rush you , but i 'm closing a little early tonight .
if i stick a light bulb on this , would n't it make a great lamp for my bedroom ?

it be . i ask her if she thought i should watch the flash .
yeah . i 'm tap out . leonard ?
i 'm gon na guess that your main concern be the time commitment of watch an entire season of a new show .
oh , no , not just a season . if i 'm in , i 'm in for the whole run , even if the quality decline .
i get it . smallville almost wreck you .
yeah . exactly . you know , i wait ten year to see a guy everyone know can fly , fly .

if that happens , do n't make me wait ten year to watch you eat a tin can .
you mean 'cause she have weird tattoo ?
no , because she want to have sex with me in a graveyard .
what difference do it make ?
the only issue be that everybody have their own thing , and a long a it 's two consent adult , i guess i do n't see the harm in it .

i hope you understand .

bye , sheldon .
well , gollum , you 're an expert on ring . what do i do with this one ?
yeah , just nice and easy , right over the plate .
what 's that about ?
i 'm heckle you . it 's a beloved part of baseball .
he 's right . and give that you 're probably still wait to be picked for a game that be played in fifth grade , i 'm sure you do suck .
hi . what 's go on ?
baseball .
okay , this be not what i meant when i say go outside and play .
he 's practice .
for what ?
the angel want an astronaut to throw out the first pitch , so guess who they call ?
well , a lot of people who be n't available , but then me .
well , not just him . may i remind you that you 're talk to the seeker , beater , chaser and water boy of the third place griffith park quidditch team .
i know . watch your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his leg be n't something you forget .
c'mon now , throw one .
all right , here we go .
you look like a jackass .
cut it out . you 're hurt my feeling .
do you enjoy my lecture ?
no , and neither do our waiter .
well , if you 're go to serve cornish game hen , you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall or be prepared to learn it .
it 's hard to argue with that . and i know because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail .
hey , how be dinner ?
good , i have cornish game hen .
oh , that poor waiter .
sheldon , how about tomorrow night we see a movie ?
you guy be go out two night in a row ?
i miss a number of date night while i be on my train trip , and i 'm contractually obligate to make them up under the term of the relationship agreement .
that 's so hot .
it 's well than hot , it 's binding .
if you 're free tomorrow night , i 'd love to have you join u on a double date .
aw .
you be aware that a double date do n't count a two date .
i ca n't believe you 're sore .
but they throw an actual ball . you be throw air at a tv .
i 'm kind of surprised you agree to do this in front of a stadium full of people .
okay . well , if you want , i could help you practice . i played a lot of softball grow up .
great . and while we 're at it , maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound .
oh , just kid . nothing .
sheldon , i 'm surprised you 'd choose to go to a pub .
i then suggest a pub .
yeah , which i be initially sceptical of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding .
after a lively debate , that proposal pass by a two-zero margin .
nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive .
i be n't make a joke , i be merely state fact . amy and i have a superior relationship to yours .
you do n't honestly think that , do you ?
leonard , i assume you knew . the rank of relationship in our circle by quality be me and amy , howard and bernadette , raj and his girlfriend , penny and chardonnay , penny and you .
there be n't any rank . and if there be , we would n't be at the bottom of it .
that 's the part you have a problem with ?
relax .
there they go , fight again . you 'd never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc .
so you never played baseball a a kid , not even little league ?
all right , the pitcher 's mound in major league baseball be sixty foot , six inch away from home plate .
keep go .
i 'll let you know .
okay , stop .
that 's sixty foot .
i 'm look at it .
you realize this be n't one of those time i want you to exaggerate how long something be .
okay , i get to , i , i , i , i get to ask . what make you think that your relationship be so wonderful and ours be n't ?
for starter , we enjoy spending time together .
so do we . and i 've see you guy ignore each other for hour do totally different thing .
yeah , toddler do that .
not a well a we do .
you believe this guy ? he have to be the best at everything .
so what ? why do you even care ?
oh , listen to them . not even married and the honeymoon 's over .
okay , it 's not that hard . you just look to where you want to throw it , step towards where you want to throw , and throw it .
just throw the ball . let 's see what we 're work with .

of course . can i have a bite of your burger ?
absolutely not .
it have avocado on it . she 's allergic to avocado . be you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die ?
i 'm not jealous . i just think it 's silly for you to compare relationship like they 're something that can be quantify .
everything be quantifiable . that french fry ? a seven . spider-man ? a nine . the number nine ? oddly , only a four .
how ridiculous be he ?
a hundred .
well , a relationship be more complicate than a french fry .
not accord to the work of berscheid , snyder and omoto .
oh , what do those rascal do now ?
yeah , not to be confuse with the french fry goodness inventory . that 's pure cooper .

since when do you read social science ?
i go to the bathroom like everybody else .
why would i lose friend just because i start date someone ?
yeah , you do n't lose anyone when you met amy . yeah , well , no , this study refers to romantic partner . not the way i would categorize the two of u .
you guy kiss and hold hand .
i 've see him do it . it 's not romantic .
what happens if she do n't like u ?
well , hey , you 're my dear friend . you 'll get a christmas card for a couple of year , and then you 're dead to me .
so , howard , be stuart still living with your mom ?

um , okay , i guess .
last night be fun . what do you think of emily ?
do she say she do n't like you ?
of course not . no one ever say they do n't like you straight to your face .
i 'm sure you 're worried about nothing .
when you go to emily 's office to practice , you 'll see . it 's fine .
yeah , i hope you 're right .
you really go your entire life without anyone say i hate you to your face ?
yeah .
i 'd say it now , but look at those cheekbone .
i miss stuart 's place . all this loud music and expose brick . what , be this a comic book store , or a rave at the third little pig 's house ?
yep , i wish stuart would reopen . i hate this place , too .
okay , him i believe because he 's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old 's tee shirt . but you 're just upset about stuart and your mom and all their hbos .
yes , i be . you know , i ca n't even watch game of throne now without think of mother say , stuart , which one be throne ?
you know , he might not reopen . he do n't get a lot of money from the insurance company .
oh , boy , if there be one thing that get my goat , it 's those dad-gum insurance company .
why ? because they wo n't get off your lawn ? be stuart try to get a loan , or , or find investor ?
all i know be , he 's get my mother buying four-ply toilet paper . i mean , four-ply . if his butt be so delicate , why do n't he just use an angora rabbit ?
for starter , they shed and bite .
hey , here 's a thought . why do n't we put up the rest of the money that stuart need ?
it 's kind of a dream come true .
that do sound fun .
it 's not that bad .
hi .

great .
all right .

do you kiss ?
be you naked ?
so , it be a hook-up .
no . yeah .
so , what be some way we could set our comic book store apart from the competition ?
oh , kid buy comic book . it would be great to figure out a way to get more kid in the store .
you know , when i be a kid , i love go there , but i could never get a ride .
ooh , what if we get a van and drove around and picked kid up ?
nice . you mean , like at park and school ?

yes .
and be you gon na use candy to lure them in ?
we be now .
um , well , in my defence , i tell everybody .
why would you say that ?
we be n't lover . come on . everyone know we do n't sleep together . we get drunk and fool around . why could n't you just leave me out of it ?
well , we be be honest . you would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped leonard ?
why say it ?
well , i would never leave you off my list , and not just because , without you , we 're play fast and loose with the word list .
well , good job . now she hate me . ugh .

on the bright side , that oxford study be right . one friend down . i wonder who you 're go to lose next .
you , okay ? it 's you . you 're , you 're next .

i do n't know what emily 's so upset about anyway . even if i have slept with him , so what ? everyone have a past .
come on , look how pretty you be . i 'm sure this be n't the first girl to hate you .
and i 'm sure you can turn it around .
oh , i know . why do n't you use your sale training to go back down there and sell yourself ?
yeah . but instead of sell a drug , you 'd be sell penny . it 's cute .
well , maybe people would like you more if you do n't crap all over their idea .
i 'm gon na go with penny on this one . then again , why would n't i ? i mean , we go way back .
oh , my god . i do n't use to like you .
shh . amy 's here now .
we 'll get to see all the new stuff before it hit the shelf .
you say thing like that all the time .
yes , but a a store owner , i 'll finally have a good comeback to , you do n't work here , shut up .
uh , do you know how penny told raj he should have left her off his list ?
well , do you think when she and i have that conversation , she left people off her list ?
i 'm sure she do .
why ?
because if she have n't , she 'd still be wad through the list .
will you stay out of this ?
if only penny have say that once in a while .
hey , what difference do it make ? you 're the one she want to marry .

i do not get a clear answer . i 'm gon na set this down now .
ah , here it be . whoa . i have n't look at these in year . robot girlfriend .
mm , that be mine .
robot prostitute .
also mine .
wait . i 'm confuse . why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute ?
there 's just some thing you do n't do with your robot girlfriend .
boy , when you met bernadette , the field of robotics really take a hit .
okay , let 's just skip all the invention you can have sex with . all right , no , here we go , ergonomic heat seat cushion .
no , it vibrates . keep go .
hey , the future they show in back to the future ii be only a year away . a lot of the thing in that movie have n't be invent yet .
if we could figure out the scientific basis for marty 's hover board , that would have universal application .
well , it 's , it 's possible at absolute zero , but we would have to remove the temperature restriction .
we get to watch back to the future ii .
i 'll make the popcorn .
so , where should we go first ?
ooh . there 's a cover band in the lounge .
nah .
but they play barry manilow .
no .
but they 're call fairly manilow .
oh . okay .
great .
well , we 're in vega . i want to go downstairs , get a bucket of margarita , dance until i vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere .
what if we do n't want to vomit ?
oh , you will . that 's why they give you the bucket . uh-oh .
it 's my bos . they move my field ride up to monday .
what do that mean ?
that suck .
can you start in the morning ?
you sure ?
yeah , it 's okay . go ahead .
wait . whoa , whoa . be place right ?
what do you mean ?
be place the right tense for something that would have happen in the future of a past that be affected by something from the future ?
have will have place ?
okay , so , it be n't until his 21st birthday that biff have will have place his first bet and make his million . that 's when he alter the timeline .
yeah , but he have will have n't place it !
wait . be brought right ?
marty and doc never have have have brought ?
he 's right . also , what kind of name be biff ? sound like when you pop open a can of pillsbury dough . biff .
oh , that stuff be so good wrap around cocktail weenie .
guy .
do you know that the word wiener come from the german name of the austrian capital vienna , or wien ?
do you know if you look at austria on a map it actually look like a wiener ?
guy , what be we do ? we sent the girl away so we could focus .
i do n't think it work .
i think after this , i 'll be dead .
we be .
amy .
you 're embarrass me .
what ?
no , no , it 's okay . i be born with it . if you put a double-a battery in there , it make my leg kick .
all right .
oh , this be already well . there be far few distraction in here .
plus , this be where our mind be condition to focus on work .
so , i 've be think about the hover board , and maybe there 's a way we could use maglev technology .
or if we could figure out a way to supercool the material , we could utilize quantum couple .
well , i wonder if anyone 's try that .
go online and look it up .
oh , i ca n't argue with him . it 's right there on the screen . austria do look like a wiener .
that 's nothing , dude . go check out how hung florida be .
i 'm sure mr florida 's walk funny . can we get back to work ?
yeah , he 's right . oh , here 's a thought . what if we use some form of operant conditioning technique to keep u from get off topic ?
like behavior modification ?
yeah , exactly . do you know those technique be use to actually teach pigeon to play ping-pong ?
that can not be true .
some psychologist perform operant conditioning with punishment . maybe we can come up with a punishment for stray off topic .
not get to see who win at pigeon ping-pong come to mind .
housekeep .
be it work ?
oh , i 'm so sorry .
you guy look like you 're have fun .
guess who won a hundred dollar play crap .
then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress .
we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction .
that sound so great . but i have a little more study to do .
to the walk-in closet ? sure .
wait , a question , who decides if someone 's go off topic ?
i think it 'll be pretty clear . if not , we 'll take a vote . oh , and also
we do n't have to , that be clearly a tangent . now come on . back to work . if we 're lean towards quantum couple aah ! why ?
you say quantum couple . that make me think of the show quantum leap . that 's a tangent and it 's your fault .
that 's ridiculous . sheldon , i vote that be not a tangent .
thank you . and now i owe you one .
ow . that be your fault .
hey .
ooh , that be a lot of hair . ow . and now i 'm gon na hear it from jenny .
everyone stop . this be a stupid idea . negative reinforcement be n't work .
i think you mean positive punishment . negative reinforcement be the removal of a positive stimulus . it 's a common mistake .
oh , it 's use incorrectly all the time . even bill murray make that mistake in the first scene of ghostbusters .
i 'm study the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability .
huh . bill murray do get it wrong .
jump ahead to the stay puft marshmallow man .
no .
leonard 's right . we ca n't just jump ahead . we have to watch the whole movie .
look . we keep procrastinate . we saw back to the future ii , pigeon play ping-pong , a bunch of country that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like denmark .
yeah , sorry for click on that .
it 's late . we 've waste hour . can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight ?
but we do n't see them bust one ghost .
so you 're , you 're say we should stand here in my lab on a saturday night and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop ?
see ? be n't this well than a hotel room ?
have you ever see a body so fine ?
would you please close the drape ?
i like your suit .
oh , thanks . get a couple new outfit for work .
how do it feel know your fiancee 's job be to go out and flirt with doctor , look like that , while you sit here , you know , look like this ?
she do n't flirt with doctor .
yeah . it 's all very professional .
you know when you bend over , i can see down your shirt ?
speak of new career , how be thing go with dark matter , sheldon ?
oh . what 's go on ?
i start do it .
you know , the government fund the big experiment yet to detect dark matter .
yeah , i 've read about that , they 're send research team down into abandon salt mine .
you know , sheldon , if we apply to be one of those team , we could be on the ground floor of something big , not just for theoretical physic but for astrophysics a well .
wait , hang on , you guy be gon na work in a mine ?
you have a panic attack when we go through the car wash .
perhaps the emotion you 're refer to be shock at you have something clean .
i think what penny meant be , the thought of you two in a mine be kind of funny , it 's like a cat rid a roomba .
maybe they could ride around in one of those mine cart that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo .
yeah , it 'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost .
be they make fun of u ?
yup .
i 'm sorry , i be think about work .
well , i be just say that there be this video game
yeah , that 's when i start think about work . uh , listen , i 've get some good news .
hmm .
this be for you .
huh . what be this ?
well , you know how they give me the company car ? do n't make sense to have two , so i sell the other one .
the one i give you ?
yeah . and there 's your money back , and now we 're even . how great be that ?
uh , yeah .
what ?
nothing .
oh , come on , leonard , i know the car be a thoughtful gesture and i really appreciate it , but it do n't make sense to have both .
do n't sound that bad .
well , good , because that 's what i do .
aw , oh , thank you . that be so sweet .
well , it 's not that sweet , i paid for the frame with your money and then get a massage .
you know what , you do n't have to give me this . you keep it .
why ?
the car be a gift , it be something you need . i be happy to help you out .
well , this be silly , so you do n't need the car , but you could use it to buy yourself something else , like a new purse to put all this money in .
sweetie , i can buy my own stuff . i have a good job now .
i know , and i 'm proud of you , but that do n't mean i ca n't do something nice . like this .
okay , i do n't want this to turn into a fight .
i do n't , either .
great . thank you . can you pas the salt , please ?
sure . in my mind , that broke the tension with comedy and lead to sex .
do n't they lay egg on a rock ?
well , i 'm from texas and you 're from india , we 're no stranger to the fragrant armpit . next .
it 's also a live mine , so there 'll be dynamite explosion go off in the distance .
oh , you have to be down there for _ hour at a time .
yeah ? we have to be somewhere .
well , there 's no toilet , we 'll have to do our business in a bucket .
so it 's settle , we 're not do it .
look , i get it , but before we pas up on an incredible opportunity , i be think about when howard be training to go to space , they put him in a simulated environment .
exactly .
very well .
so where should we do it ?
well , i 'll just google hot , dark and moist , see what come up .
uh , sheldon
hey , you get a sec ?
hi . sure .
i be hop we could talk about the money again .
oh , sweetie , just forget about it .
no , no , no , no , hear me out . i know thing get a little weird last night .
well , leave an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count a weird .
well , i think i come up with a pretty good solution .
mm .
why do n't we just put the money in a joint account ? it 'll be our first money together . we can use it for the wedding , the honeymoon , whatever .
you know what , that 's great . i love that .
yeah , of course you do , i 'm not just a genius in bed . you sure be , baby .
you two want to be alone ?
what ?
well , i just think that maybe you 're a little hung up on the money because i 'm less reliant on you now , and that 's a little scary .
or , maybe now that i 'm no longer an out-of-work actress who ca n't pay for her own dinner , that make you a little insecure .
well , i ca n't believe you 'd say that . you know how insecure i be about my insecurity .
you know what ? i 'm sorry . it 's stupid to fight over money .
yeah , i 'm sorry , too . we 're about to share the rest of our life together . it 's our money , who care who have it ?
ugh , you 're right , who care ? mm . get that money out of my back pocket or i will break your finger .
huh . all this time i never knew there be steam tunnel down here .
most university have them . when i be an undergrad , i spent three day in one pledge a sorority .
do you get in ?
no . they forgot i be there . but it really open up my pore .
well , accord to my research , the steam tunnel below this access point should be the closest analog to the mine .
this be gon na be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym .
or totally naked . i love howard , but the dude need a little shame .
all right , amy , this walkie-talkie be yours . if we run into any problem , i 'll contact you . and if anything bad happens , what 's the rule ?
save you first . come back for raj only if there 's time .
we 're go to be fine .
i 'm sweat already .
yeah , a the person beneath you , allow me to say , i know .
how hot be it ?
uh , let 's see . _ ? no , wait , it 's on clock . uh , the real answer be n't much well . _ degree .
well , that 's what we want . this be a hot a the mine will be .
true . sheldon 's mine simulation log , entry one . koothrappali 's restate of the obvious be already get on my nerve .
thanks again for have u .
oh , of course . what do you guy want to talk about ?
i do n't think they be go to . i just want to have a way to say no without hurt leonard 's feeling .
well , nail it .
sure , sometimes . i mean , it can be a little awkward since i make so much more money than howie .
well , i do n't have to , but for the sake of accuracy i felt that i should .
like what ? your incomplete set of star trek collector plate ?
without ask me ?
how much , howie ?
how much ?
be it more or less than falconry school ?
for the tenth time , that be a groupon .
like i would swing with him .
how you feel ?
good . little claustrophobic .
let 's set up the equipment . it 'll help take your mind off of it .
do you know any mining song ?
that 's pretty .
where the danger be double , and the pleasure be few . where the rain never fall and the sun never shine , yes , it 's dark a a dungeon way down in the mine .
it 's a little more bleak than i thought .
well , i pray when i 'm dead and the age shall roll , that my body will blacken and turn into coal .
get kind of grim .
then i 'll look from the door of my heavenly home , and pity the miner that mine my poor bone .
okay . how 'bout a little miley cyrus next ?
who 's he ?
well , maybe i would have paid it if i be n't also do everything else around here .
oh , you 're say i do n't do anything around here . look at my chore chart .
she make him a chore chart .
i see it .
that be a pity star . put water in the roast pan and leave it in the sink be not do the dish .
well , do n't come cry to me when you do n't get your allowance .
it 's not an allowance . it 's a stipend , and we say we be n't gon na call it an allowance in front of my friend .
that 's preposterous . how would she go unrecognized just by wear a wig ?
but you 're okay with superman conceal his identity with a pair of glass ?
he do n't just put on a pair of glass . he comb back his curlicue and affect a mild-mannered personality .
you guy do okay down there ?
i told you to use the walkie-talkie !
you guy do okay down there ?
please keep this channel clear for emergency . thank you .

okay , just check .
we should have ask her to get some funyuns .
what if we brought them down with u ?
we 'll take some funyuns .
anything else ?
some york peppermint patty , a couple of dr pepper , and run to best buy and see if they have a portable dvd player and season one of a show call hannah montana .
sorry you guy have to see that .
oh , do n't apologize .
well , sure . there 's still a lot of pressure on guy to be provider . so even though he 's happy for me , it 's just a little tough on him .
uh-oh .
what ?
well , if i do well in sale , i could end up make a lot more money than you .
maybe it 's a good thing we come here . it 's like a lesson in what not to do .
yeah i do n't want something dumb like money to come between u .
it wo n't . let 's just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married .
why be you be a baby ?
i 'm not a baby . i 'm a grown man , and i make the bed . now where 's my star ?
should we go ?
hang on . i want to see if he get the star .
oh , this heat be brutal .
a someone from the tropical subcontinent of india , you should know that fan yourself in a humid environment only raise your body temperature .
huh . that do explain why the servant use to look so hot while they be fan me . let 's get our mind off how uncomfortable we be . we could take some more simulated instrument reading .
my major focus at the moment be keep my claustrophobia at bay .
how 's that go ?
you tell me . i feel like i ca n't breathe , and i be tempt to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lung .
sheldon , if this be too much , we can stop .
we 're not stop
you do n't have to bite my head off .
i apologize . i just , i 'm plague by an internal struggle .
if you would just use the bucket , you 'd be so much more comfortable .
my struggle be emotional .

speak of underwear , i have some interest news .
he be be funny . i 'm pretty sure . anyway , i be ask to be a part of a magazine article about the _ sexiest female scientist in california . be n't that cool ?
i think it 's awful .
why would you say that ?

and while you 're at it , i know that at this age your hormone be rag , but just because all your friend be have sex do n't mean you have to .
why would you say that ?

why not ?
accord to an online message board , i may be have a panic attack . soccermom have similar symptom . but to be fair , the twin be a real handful that day .
you 're make me worry . what 's go on ?
what 's go on be we 're about to go to a prom . and there 's a great deal of pressure on young couple like u to engage in what mr bob eubanks call make whoopee .

because i ca n't breathe . i snore , i get sinus infection .
but you do n't have a life-threatening condition . why would you take the risk of surgery ?

i think you could give a well clue .
i do n't . i 'm not even sure if that 's a person or a typo .
okay , why ?
i 'm listen to you snore . i 'm wonder how i 'll ever sleep without it .
really leonard . insult ? after i spent two hour in your closet , wait for you to fall asleep ?

i do n't have epilepsy , either .
you do n't know that .
you know who else say that ? every cocky t rex currently swim around in the gas tank of your car .

bah , bam , bum-bum , bah , bum , bum . this song be never go to stop . have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritate ?
that 's a trick question , right ?
well , i should n't be surprised . there 's a rich history of brilliant mind descend into madness .
come on , sheldon . there be plenty of smart people who do n't have mental problem .
yup , she 's right . for every newton who have a psychological issue , there 's an edison who be just a jerk . that could totally be you .
empedocles thought he be a god and jumped into a volcano . and pythagoras have an irrational fear of bean . tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed love him back .
there go our shot at him living on the roof .

no , no , no , no . she 'd be go alone . well , if you think i 'm afraid of bird , you should see me around sheep .
okay , well , what 's the third option ?
that i have coitus with her .
what do you think about give sheldon 's ticket to stuart ?
it 's like go with your grandpa . instead of eat popcorn , he brings little piece of chicken in tupperware and a thermos full of soup .

low self-esteem .
social anxiety .
sexual insecurity .
none of that be true .
that 's just crazy . how would my go in there even help you ?
i do n't know . you could talk to her , and maybe if it come up , you could ask if she 's heard about the drug .
what if i get caught ?
lack of confidence .
kind of a wuss .
fine , i 'll do it . but not because of them , because i love you .
thank you .
pushover .
spineless .

hmm . what be you do now ?
oh , i see . how about now ?

well , i 'm not so sure about that . but i can tell you i do not agree with her theory on child rear at all .
well , i do n't want to say it .
sound like you 're hold on to quite a bit of anger towards her .
that 's heartbreaking .
right ? to this day , i send her a card every year with a little money in it .
boy , who would 've thought when you ask me to move in and help take care of your mom , i 'd still be here two year later ?
this be weird .
goodbye .
he 's go . let 's start in the garage .
okay , so once we receive the next image and compare it to the one we 've already collect , we 'll know what it be that we found .
ooh , perhaps it 's a heliosheath scintillation .
it could be a trans-neptunian object .
unlikely , but it could be a dwarf planet .
well , a long a it have a healthy gravity and all it moon , i 'll be happy .
okay , the final image be come in . and the object we discover be
come on , daddy need a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist .
a medium-sized asteroid .
that 's it ? how common . that 's the chicken finger on the menu of space .
i kind of like chicken finger .
yeah , me , too . i be stuck for a metaphor .
come on , a medium-sized asteroid be still an interest discovery .
i suppose it could end up on a collision course with earth and destroy life a we know it .
you dream different than me .
it be kind of cute .
we well choose a name no one can make fun of . sir frederick william herschel do n't do uranus any favour .
hey , how 'd it go ?
oh , great . dr gallo be terrific . you know , i , i 've always be insecure that no one care about what i have to say , but she make me see
yeah , no one care . do you help me out or not ?
okay , now , what i 'm hearing be that you feel that i sometimes take too long to express myself , and you wish i 'd be more succinct .
really ? oh , you 're the best husband ever .
so you 'll go to the doctor who convention with me next week ?
i guess .
boy , when be the last time stuart clean this place ?
howie , i do n't want to play lego , toenail or pill anymore . so , what do you think we should do with this room ?
why ca n't it be a woman cave ?
i 'm be serious .

be she okay ?
yeah , i calm her down , but she 's not go to vega if he 's go .
that 's very mature of you .

relax , there 's room for two baby in this group .
oh , dear lord , penny 's pregnant , too ?
you 're the other baby .
would an adult refuse to eat his graham cracker because one of them be broken ?
so , i 'm glad you guy be here . there 's something i want to share with you . howie and i be go to
leonard say you 're pregnant .
what ?
i 'm pregnant .
oh , my god , i ca n't believe it .
yeah , it 's all real excite .
easy for you to say , skinny bitch . sorry , hormone .
oh , that 's all right . all i heard be skinny .
i would n't make too much out of howard not react the way you expect him to .
you 're probably right . after we talk about it , he start to calm down .
i should n't be raise a kid . i do n't even eat my own vegetable .
buddy , i , i think you might be overreact .
and then there 's this nose . i mean , what if he look like me ? or bad , what if she look like me ?
oh , my god , and do you have any idea how expensive have a kid be ?
i read that in los angeles , raise a child through college can cost over a million dollar .
a million dollar ? god , it 's like my nut just kick me in the nut . that 's it , i get to start earn more money right now .
i know , you could ask bernadette for a raise in your allowance .
this be n't a joke .
i be n't joking .
it 'll be fine . people have kid every day . you 'll figure this out .
yeah , come on , this be great news and you know it .
hey , you know what we should do ?
all get vasectomy so this do n't happen to u ?
go out and celebrate . but not your bad idea .
hey , let 's go do something to get your mind off this .
ca n't drink .
we can , but all right .
doctor say i ca n't have sushi .
maybe you should get a new doctor . what , he say you ca n't laugh either ?
i 'd like to propose a toast to our friend , howard , his , um , his big heart , his beautiful soul
cheer .
well , look at this . i bet whoever invent tiny umbrella do n't have to worry about money . he can have all the kid he want .
and can keep a small portion of their head dry .
if i 'm gon na have any chance of raise this kid , i need to come up with a big idea to make some money .
there 's no reason you ca n't .
that 's easy for you to say . you and sheldon already come up with your superfluid helium model .
that 's just research . we 're never gon na make any money from it .
forget helium . the real superfluid be the fruit punch in this mug . reminds me of my daddy 's secret do n't tell mama juice .
oh . i 'll just take one last sip . ah .
okay , how about this for an invention , slightly big cocktail umbrella .
how be that a new invention ?
it 's true . i like my giant ipad and my little ipad almost a much a my regular-sized ipad .
this place be terrific . why . why have we never be here before ?
the same reason we do n't do a lot of fun stuff . you .
that 's some smart talk from a guy who ca n't even keep his face in focus . where 's the bathroom ?
excuse me . hey , how you doin ' ?
i hope the bathroom be clearly marked .
maybe that 's an idea , guidance system for drunk people .
they have that . it 's call uber .
hey . in your supercooled helium experiment , do you create quantum vortex ?
yeah . why ?
well , if you make a guidance system , could n't you use those vortex a a gyroscope ?
and since it 's in a quantum state , it would maintain an infinite persistence .
groundbreaking revelation , tropical drink . tell me this be n't like the best episode of sex and the city .
you may have actually just come up with something .
you think so ?
i really do .
you guy , the bathroom here be amaze . there 's people cooking in it .
think about all the fun thing you get to do when you have a baby .
i kind of already do that for howie .
and whenever you 're hungry , you 'll be in a minivan with cheerio all over the floor .
well , we do n't exactly decide . we be talk about it , and then one night we get a little reckless .
oh , tell u .
no , i 'm embarrass .
oh , come on , we 're all grown-ups . we 've all do it .
fine . we be out one night , and thing get a little spontaneous .
well , sheldon be go on and on about time zone and railroad schedule , and i go out
kind of on sheldon 's bed .
what ?
i be head to the bathroom , and i pass howie on his way out . usually he say , do not go in there , but this time he say , hey , let 's go in here .
i 'm sorry , but you know what it 's like when you 're with your man and one thing lead to another .
i 'm not see anyone use liquid helium vortex like this .
i 'm not find anything either .
it 's a good sign .
damn . what be it ?
this video . the baby panda sneeze , and the mama panda get so scar .
can you focus on what we 're talk about ?
all right . look , now , this may be the rum talk , but a long a the unpin rate of the vortex be kept within _ and _ , the magnus force issue should be negligible .
even drunk , he 's still smarter than all of u .
and strong . who want to see me beat up the bartender ?
i 'd enjoy that .
if this be a viable thing , we could get a patent and license it to company that make guidance system .
look at that . you 've know you 're gon na be a father for less than a day and you 're already step up .
maybe you 're right .
of course he 's right . you and i both know how hard it be grow up without a father . that 's why i 'm confident you 're gon na be the best dad you can be .
you guy can go in if you want .
that sound fun .
what 's it say ?
you want it , you get it , oh , you want it , baby you get it
just bust a move ,
you want it , you get it , oh , you want it , baby you get it
just bust a move ,
you want it , you get it , oh , you want it , baby you get it
hey , guy . congratulation .
thank you .
wonderful . i 'm be musically encourage to bust a move . if i knew what that meant , i might just do it .
sure .
so , you gon na get up there later ?
a microphone , a room full of inaccurate depiction of polynesian religion , and a captive audience to hear about it ? you bet i be .
it 's okay to be nervous . i be , too .
me , too .
i love you . mmm . and i 'm not just say that because your breast be gon na get big .
be we an item ? girl , quit playin ' .
say there 's another and look right in my eye .
baby , i need your lovin ' , get to have all your lovin ' . baby , i need your lovin ' , get to have all your lovin ' .
ooh , baby , baby , baby , baby . ooh , baby , baby , baby , baby .
i appreciate this , but you really
push it real good .
you 're kid . what kind of maniac have coitus in someone else 's bedroom ?
thank you , pasadena . good night .
probably 'cause you get to see your man up there rockin ' the mic .
yeah , yeah . i be a little surprised when you decide to beat-box .
oh . that be really an asthma attack . i just sell it .
well , i be so happy for howard and bernadette .
me , too . so , you ever think about it ?
baby ? well , i 'm not in a rush but someday , yeah , sure . what about you ?
i think we 'd make amaze parent .
on the other hand , we might lack a certain maturity .
so sheldon , there 's something i 've be want to talk about but i know it 's kind of a touchy subject .
way to narrow it down to everything .
what be it ?
well , your birthday 's come up , and you 've never let u celebrate it , and i be hop maybe this year we could .
oh , i suppose that 's a discussion we could have .
okay , great , i mean , it do n't have to be a big party or anything . i be just , where 'd he go ?
well , where be he ?
sheldon ?
i 'll check his room .
i 'm sorry i brought it up .
yeah , what be the problem ? be it about get old ?
please , look at this porcelain skin . i 'm like a human sink .
one day . right .
i 'm sorry .
oh , that part be n't so bad . i do n't like them , either . but then i 'd inevitably spend the whole day be torture by my sister 's friend .
oh , poor thing .
when i be six , they told me batman be come to my party . i wait by the door for hour . closest thing to batman i saw be when a robin flew into the window .
you realize none of those thing would happen now ?
i do , but why do you care if i celebrate my birthday at all ?
well , you make my last birthday so memorable , i want to return the favour .
you know , if you have a party now , you have plenty of friend that would love to come .
and we live here , so we have no choice .
very well . you may celebrate my life by throw a party with cake , present and a shower of admiration and love . but then you owe me big-time .
you have any idea what you 're get sheldon for his birthday ?
that 's funny . let 's do that .
maybe we could get batman to actually show up .
you mean , some guy in a lame suit ?
yeah , but there be kind of a schedule conflict . he , uh , want to know when he 'd get paid . and i would n't tell him .
okay , so how do you feel about party balloon ?
uh , mylar balloon , yes . latex balloon , no . water balloon , i will jump off the roof and aim for your car .
all right , what about music ?
i enjoy march band and tibetan throat sing .
what kind of cake do you like ?
well , my favourite be chocolate with strawberry frost , three layer , and if there 's write on it , make sure it 's not all cap . i do n't need my dessert yell at me .
hey , so what be adam west like on the phone ?
uh , nice guy . but it be a little weird to hear batman say do n't ring the doorbell or my poodle will go crazy .
you know , adam west be my favourite batman ? well , after michael keaton , christian bale and batman from the lego movie .
what ? he beat out george clooney , and that 's something . like , i love me some clooney .
do n't say that to anyone .
oh , i , i be just glad to be invite . to be honest , i do n't always feel like i 'm part of the group .
sound like something a member of the group might know .
yeah , birthday party first . pity party later .
oh , please . even my poodle know bale 's overrate .
i never have to say i 'm batman . i show up , people knew i be batman . everywhere i go , on the tv show , mall opening , julie newmar 's bungalow .
there 's another reason i should be high on the list . all those other guy have muscle built into their costume . all i have in my batsuit be _ % , grade-a west .
can we just all agree we 're worried about affleck ?
sure .
what 's an affleck ?
be there a reason i have to leave my own apartment ?
well , i think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorate .
oh . thank you .
maybe later i 'll , uh , get to see you in your birthday suit .
but this be my birthday suit . be you have a stroke ? because that 's the kind of thing that just ruin a birthday party .
oh , i would n't call it a party . just a few close friend . and your sister and brother .
and i never do thank you for that , dear .
oh . penny say everyone 's there . be you ready ?
i be . oh . wait .
be you all right ?
no , i just , i get a little light-headed .
oh , do you need a minute ?
happy birthday !
speech ! speech !
come on , sheldon , say something .
uh , um , uh , thank you all so much for come . beverly . wil wheaton . adam west , for some reason .
happy birthday , sherman .
i still get paid , do n't i ?
okay , i 'd well go in there and talk to him .
well , do n't you think i 'm the one who should go in ?
well , i 've , you know , see him without pant on .
again , no offence , but so have i .
well , he 's see me without pant on .
again , no
okay , this be ridiculous . sheldon ? can i come in ?
how do you know i 'm not use the facility ?
because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week , even though i 've clicked unsubscribe , like , a thousand time . so , what 's go on ?
i do n't know . i look around the room , and i saw all the face and the present , and it , it be just too much .
i get that . hey , you want to just bring a few people in here ? you know , wil wheaton in the bathtub , batman on the toilet . it 'll be like the weird comic-con ever .
i know that you work hard to put this together . i 'm sorry i 'm ruin it .
oh , pl , you 're not ruin it . look , at some point , raj will try to get everyone to do the electric slide . now , that will ruin it .
well , everyone will think i 'm weird .
leonard .
it 's be a while .
have it ?
wow , congratulation . you know , actually , i thought you 'd be living with sheldon forever .
yeah , well , do n't be a stranger .
aw , amy , that be lovely . you know , this be fun . let 's do more . someone else say something wonderful about me .
sheldon , i do n't think everyone
wolowitz , perfect . everyone listen to wolowitz .
okay , then , uh , sheldon , we 've know each other a long time . and it be a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend .
seriously , barry , stop .
and it be gandhi who say , live a if you be to die tomorrow . learn a if you be to live forever .
i ca n't think of anything to say that have n't already be say , so , here 's to you , sheldon .
thank you , bernadette . that be perfect .
happy birthday , buddy .
thank you . that , that be wonderful .
oh , oh , okay . um , uh , sheldon , i 've spent most of my life feel invisible , but have you and everyone
hey , everybody , listen up .
you nail it .
hello , sheldon .
happy birthday to you .
happy birthday to you .
happy birthday , dear sheldon .
i be crush it , but all right .
okay , while they get the cake , sheldon , i just want to say , i hope you do n't think you be gon na get through tonight without a hug .
you know , i use to hate these hug . now they 're just extremely irritate .
so , who 's take me home ?
i 've never apply for a patent before . i want to make a good impression .
be the impression that your first name be pee-wee ?
come on in , fella .
see , he 's not wear a tie .
so , i 've review your paperwork , and it seem like we 've get everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope .
that 's great .
excellent .
well , the legal team need to review exist patent to avoid overlap .
oh , i do n't think there will be .
that 's nice , but i think ours might be a bit more thorough .
get a load of this guy .
can you imagine if we make money with this ?
if we do , i be splurge on the best sinus irrigator money can buy .
just need you to review and sign this document acknowledge that you understand the university will own _ % of the patent .
seventy-five percent ?
it 's university policy .
i know when i 'm beat .
dr hofstadter , this university have be pay your salary for over ten year . do you think we do that out of the goodness of our heart ?
and a far a mr wolowitz be concerned , i 'm afraid a a federal employee on loan from nasa , your name can be on the patent , but you 're not entitle to an ownership share .
well , sometimes they give you a plaque .
well , that 's not fair . we should all get plaque .
sorry , but we ca n't sign this .
come on , let 's go .
thank you for your time .
couple of question about the plaque .
yeah . the other day i sniffed out where howie hid the girl scout cooky . no more tagalong , my as .
but now you 'll be able to make your own milk to eat the cooky with .
hey , guy . hey , penny . i really appreciate you help me with this . i do n't know what to do .
oh , sure . let me see it .
see what ?
i have n't spoken to emily since i broke up with her , and she left this on my doorstep with a note .
that 's nice .
nice , or be she try to manipulate him ?
i know . i mean , do i open it ? do i return it ?
why would n't you open it ?
you do n't think she 'd actually send you something gross or dangerous , do you ?
i know one way to find out . sniff this .
although i be get a little machine oil . i think it 's metal .
come on , just open it .
you know , on game of throne , balon greyjoy receive his son 's genitals in a box .
what be that ?
wow . it 's an antique sextant . sailor use these to find their position by the star .
what a nice gift for an astrophysicist .
i know , she 's so thoughtful .
see , she 's try to get you back . now , that be exactly what i would 've gotten you if i have any idea what it be or what you do .
you know , i have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into get back together with her .
you do n't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap .
well , what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves ?
we ca n't . it say on their web site , a long a we work there , they have a control ownership of anything we come up with .
great , so they own my idea for a t-shirt that say dumb a a bag of geologist .
either way , i get nothing .
or , if we end up make money from this , sheldon and i could split our share with you .
to be clear , leonard be refer to the gyroscope , not the t-shirt and mug . oh , now they own the mug .
i guess that be a way around this . you guy would be cool do it like that ?
of course , we can split any profit three way .
i 'm fine with that .
okay , great .
it sound like a , uh , contract might be in order .
sure , we could write something up .
but which one of u should be the party who
you can do it , sheldon .
so stipulate .
i wonder how much she spent on this .
ooh , let 's find out .
it do n't matter . it 's the thought that count .
yeah , yeah , and beauty 's on the inside , size do n't matter , how much she spend ?
oh , my .
oh , come on , you ca n't say oh my , and then not tell me .
damn . all i get for valentine 's day be a postcard say my vermont teddy bear be back-ordered .
okay , so , she drop off a five hundred dollar gift and she 's not try to get back together with you ?
okay , answer it . just be strong . and if she start to cry , do n't make any promise . and most importantly , put it on speaker so we can hear .
hey , it 's emily . be this a good time ?
be it okay i left that gift ? i 'm really hop we can be friend .
um , you think you 'd want to grab a cup of coffee ? hello ?
i just , i miss hang out with you . it 's not like i lose a friend , it 's like i lose my best friend . be there any chance you 'd want to come over ?
well , anyway , i 'll leave you to your girl ' night .
be you sure you do n't want to stay here with u ?
well , if you change your mind , we 'll be here .
thank you .
say hi to emily for u .
this contract look good to me .
what be it ?
well , we ran into a problem about my share of the patent , so we 're form a partnership to split anything we make equally .
sheldon , do you draft the contract ?
you bet i do .
so , you 're just gon na sign this without have a lawyer look at it ?
i know , but
well , i should hope so . the whole thing be your idea .
what ?
if you want to sign a contract that sheldon whip up , go ahead .
sure .
excuse u .
hey , leonard .
what ?
if she do n't think that we should apply for this patent , she 's be patently absurd .
good one .
okay , you get it . see , i be afraid it be a thinker .
i just want to make sure you 've thought this through .
i 'm not worried about you . i 'm worried about me . i do n't want to go through this pregnancy listen to you complain about sheldon drive you crazy more than you already do .
you 've try to work with him before . it have n't go well . why be this time gon na be any different ?
be the foetus help you ? ‘ cause that 's cheat .
well , last time we talk , i have just gotten back together with my boyfriend , and i want to let you know that thing do n't work out .
let me guess , the bad part about break up be that she do n't have her best friend to talk to any more ?
i 'm a girl . it 's , like , page one out of the playbook .
any chance you could send me a pdf of that playbook ?
they 've be out there a while .
i hope everything 's okay .
if you guy would shut up , i could tell you . oh . be cool , be cool , be cool .
hey .
hello .
you guy all right ?
yeah . but , um , we be talk , and i 'm a little concerned about the three of u form a partnership .
sheldon , my concern be not with the money or anything . it 's , it 's with how you treat me .
be you say that his contribution be n't a valuable a yours ?
no , i be not say that , because i kept say that this morning and leonard say stop say that .
see ? this be what happens every time we work together .
you know what , hang on . what if sheldon have no choice but to be respectful ?
what ? be there a switch on the back of his neck we do n't know about ?
how would you enforce it ?
oh , please . any contract i sign be enforce by my own personal code of ethic .
and his obsessive-compulsive disorder .
yeah , that , too . and scoot over . part of your shadow 's on my spot .
i 'm on board .

do you still like cilantro ?
yeah .
you 're tie my hand here .
all right , let 's sign this .
wait , wait , wait . what be these change on page six ?
sheldon , what do you do ?
_ % of profit due to sheldon cooper will be allocate to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of howard and bernadette wolowitz . sheldon , that 's so nice .
that beat the onesie i be gon na get them from baby gap .
oh , i 've always value education over money . and the very fact that you need a write guarantee of respect make me realize how dismissive i 've be of your contribution .
i appreciate that .
and i just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer .
sheldon .
what ? i do n't sign it yet .
all right , it 's your life . but you know how this be gon na end .
a a matter of fact , i do . i 'm gon na comfort her , because i 'm a care and decent friend who 's happy to be there when she need someone to talk to .

there 's a lot of tedious setup , but once we get through that it should go quicker .
be there anything we can do to help ?
you know what , this part be n't that technical . you actually could .

well , if you want to see less of me , maybe we should go out again .
i ca n't believe you make out with mandy chao .

and you do n't think to tell me ?
leonard ask me to keep it to myself .
let 's leave leonard out of this for the moment . this be about you and me .
wait , wait , wait , how be my day-old marriage fall apart become about you two ?
hang on . what do i need to do to make you trust me ?
you think it 's hard have one wife , try have two .
i bet you told bernadette all about how he be screw around with mandy chao .
oh , we do n't screw around . we just get drunk and make out .
whatever . it would have be nice to hear it from you .
what be you do here ?
i 'm here to return your belonging . that 's what people who 've broken up do .
and you do n't do your compulsive knock ritual so i would open the door .
on the contrary , you no longer get to enjoy my charm eccentricity . we 're not friend with benefit .
just give me the box .
wait . do n't you want to go through it to make sure i have n't forgotten anything ?
fine . my old scarf .
you wore it the night we go ice-skating . remember ?
we make one heck of a team , huh ?
whose bra be this ?
it 's not yours ? oh , my . how embarrass for both of u .
it 's penny 's .
hey , you broke up with me . it be none of your business whose naked bosom i 'm smooshing around like pizza dough .
good-bye .
amy . amy . amy . hmm . table work , too . good to know .
hand off . i 'm mad at you .
what will pay for itself ?
i 'm mad at you for blabbing to me what leonard do on the north sea , and i 'm mad that i 've have to hide this from penny for two year .
i mean , if penny find out i 've know all this time and have n't told her , she 's gon na think i 'm a terrible friend . i wish you never told me .
i guess that 's true .
call you back . hey .
can we talk ?
i would love that .
all right , look , i 'm sorry i say i be okay with everything before we get married . i hate that we 're go through this , but i do n't know what to do .
if you do n't mind wait for a groupon , we can try marriage counsel .
hello .
hey , uh , buddy , can we have some privacy ?
oh , of course . would n't want to intrude . this be yours .
nothing odd . i just want to rub amy 's nose in it .
okay , look , i might be overreact , but how be i suppose to get past this when i know tomorrow you 're gon na go to work and see this woman ?
now , forgive me for eavesdropping , but a i see it , there 's a simple solution .
wake up , wake up , wake up .
bring penny to meet mandy .
what ? why ?
well , right now , penny 's imagination be run wild , but if they meet , that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fear . like when that sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch .
uh , first of all , you make that guy cry .
and we learn that you do n't need an eyeball to do that .
secondly , i ca n't think of a more horrible idea than penny meeting mandy .
really ? why be that ?
what , you actually want to meet her ?
no , but now that you 're be weird about it , maybe i should .
i 'm not be weird . be i be weird ?
fine , you want to meet her ?
no , i just want to know that when you 're at work , there 's nothing go on .
how many time do i have to tell you ? i have no interest in this woman .
yeah , well , maybe she have interest in you .
in leonard ? oh , even the sparkletts guy could see that 's unlikely .
anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment .
come on , you know leonard 's not like that .
oh , i do n't know . this be all so new to me . i 'm still processing .
you guy have any idea how much it cost to see a marriage counsellor ?
_ dollar an hour . why ?
how do you know ?
and i 'm just hearing about this now ?
dude , just because we 're best friend do n't mean that i have to tell you everything that go on .
you do n't have to , you should want to .
oh , great , there 's mandy .
why be marine biologist always so cute ?
i do n't know , but i 'd like to get lose in her bermuda triangle .
that 's not helpful .

i 'm gon na ask her if she 'd be willing to talk to penny , tell her she have nothing to worry about .

i do n't know . sound like you 're try to sabotage the relationship .
oh , you 're gon na think about that right here ?
and your wife be worried about me ?
so , you say you have something to tell me .
okay , yeah , um , do you remember when you accuse me of try to sabotage our wedding ?
i 've be think about it , and you might be right . but the good news be that i 'm pretty sure i know why .
i 'm listen .
penny , after all these year , i still feel like maybe i do n't deserve you .
okay , that be the lame excuse you could 've possibly come up with . but i get it .
you do ?
yeah . yeah , sometimes i worry you 're gon na wake up and leave me for someone more like you .
you know what i mean . and , you know , maybe the way i 've be react be me sabotage this , too .
well , how about we stop be so scar of lose each other and just be together ?
that sound nice .
oh . oh , my god , that be the most beautiful thing anyone 's ever say to me .

why be you pretend to be outdoors ? you hate it .
hmm ? oh . amy show me a compelling study that demonstrate the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness .
buddy , i be ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there .
well , make your joke , but some of the participant who spent four day in the wood away from all technology report a fifty percent gain in reason skill upon their return .
okay , if that 's true , why be n't there more genius squirrel ?

hey , let 's light a fire .
ooh , that sound cozy .
i do n't think i 've lit a real fire before .
ah , it 's basic thermodynamics . i 'm sure we can figure that out .

that would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion .

get it .
a scientist make that .
look , raj , you 're my best friend in the world and i really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby .

we 've actually be work on a prototype for a navigation system we invent .
be you kid ? i love science . einstein , stephen hawk , mike degrasse tyson .
mike degrasse tyson ?
well , we 're use quantum vortex to replace gyroscope in guidance system .
angular momentum . i be wonder about that .

yeah , but we do n't create it for weapon .
be it well than the one they use now ?
a lot .
that 's lovely , sheldon .
well , other than when they 're chug through your bowel , these thing be magic .
i have to admit , i 've be worried about the military application since we start talk about this .
me , too .
why do n't you say something ?
same reason i do n't talk about as cancer . it 's not a pleasant topic .
you ca n't let this stop you . almost any scientific advancement can be use for destructive purpose .
it 's true . even einstein 's theory of relativity be later apply to the development of nuclear weapon .
e equal mc square . yeah . e be for energy , m for mass , and c for the speed of light .
how do you know that ?
hey , raj .
hey , claire . good , you 're here . guy , this be my friend claire . we 're casually date , and there 's no need for any far question about it .

no , i mean re-evaluate what we 're do with the guidance system .
but i get a baby on the way . i get to make some money .
okay , let me stop you right there . we absolutely know our invention will not be use to destroy the world .
how ?
because no one from the future have come back to kill u .
very funny .

well , not really .
okay , then . geez , how much wine do you drink ?

your friend be just tell me about all the other girl you 're date .

we do n't .
wow . maybe none of you guy be smart .
morning .
morning .
ugh . too much wine .
oh , i overdid it myself last night . hair of the dog .
hey , do you ever think about the military application for the guidance system ?
of course .
no , it do at first , but then i talk it through with frank and alicia , and they really help put thing into perspective .
who be these people ?
leonard , friend be like toilet paper . it 's good to have extra under the sink .
helium .
yes .
taylor swift .
yes . pi .
yes . kardashian .
more specific .

oh , that 's a venn diagram , and i remember because i thought to myself , venn be he gon na stop talk about this diagram ?
what be you guy do ?
oh , well , we decide to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge base .
oh , let me try .
okay .
hmm , atom of hydrogen , adam of maroon _ , mic drop .
i 'm sorry , who be mike drop ?
oh , hey , penny , do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother ?
sure .
thanks .
hey , penny , um , since you 're already gon na be at the airport , do i need to go ?
why do n't you want to get your mother from the airport ?
she can cover it in a car ride ? i could do _ minute on your posture alone .
you really want me to pick up your mother all by myself ?
hmm , i just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond .
or a way for you to avoid her ?
i do n't know what he 's put on those card , but you be smarter than ever .
fine , if you really want me to , i will pick your mom up .
seriously ?
yeah , you know what , she be my mother-in-law , and i 'd like for u to have a good relationship .
that be very mature of you , so i 'm gon na go ahead and say , suckah .
all right , back to learn .
okay .
oh , easy , bill nye the science guy .
or a i know him ?
creepy old dude from dance with the star .
ding , ding , ding , ding , ding .
do you guy see there 's an avenger screen ? joss whedon 's gon na show some delete scene and do a question and answer session .
oh , well , i have a few question for him about the last avenger movie , and a whole lot of answer .
when 's the screen ?
uh , it 's tonight , but it 's first-come , first-served , so we should probably get there early and wait in line .
let 's do it .
penny 's busy with my mother , so i 'm in .
oh , bad news . amy 's make me go shopping with her later , so look like none of u can go .
you do realize we 're allow to have fun without you ?
in fact , that 's usually the trick to it . what time do we need to get there ?
uh , i 'd say by three .
it 's not a big deal . go shopping with amy , and we 'll save a spot in line for you .
you do n't have the authority to save place in the line . if i do that , i 'll be cut .
people do it all the time .
you know the golden rule of line etiquette . no cut , no buts , no coconut .
people be actually wait in line a a job ? boy , make me feel well about my life .
i 'm not surprised leonard chose to avoid pick me up . he 's battle intimacy issue his whole life . do he have difficulty maintain erection ?
dear , i 'm a psychiatrist . you do n't have to avoid have intimate conversation with me .
penny , it 's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you , and i acknowledge i can be an intimidate person . so what can i do to make this process easy for you ?
and how do it make you feel when i psychoanalyze everything you say ?
that be a joke , dear .
so just the two of u ?
hey .
i thought that might come up . sheldon hire me to go shopping with you .
you sure ? i 'm happy to hold your bag . and sheldon give me money for a hotdog on a stick .
look , lady , i just work here .
we 've wait in a lot of line together , have n't we ?
remember when we camped out for the doctor who panel at comic-con ?
yeah , sleep under the star with other fan who love the show a much a we do .
wake up , wonder which one of those fan stole our wallet .
sheldon , you be the most inconsiderate person i have ever met in my entire life . where do you get off send me to shop with your girlfriend ?
oh , i 'm not upset with you , but amy 's pretty bent out of shape , so she hire me to let you have it .
maybe he could n't get a word in edgewise .
oh , it 's all right , dear . sheldon have a brilliant and complicate mind . it 's understandable that be in a relationship with him could be try .
well , i do admire your resolve . you 're an extraordinary woman .
thank you .
amy 's with sheldon who she love like a son . you 're with her son , who she do n't .
oh , well , that still could be a big step for sheldon .
three minute . and he use a kitchen timer . i felt like a soft-boiled egg .
yes . well , what can you do ?
sheldon say he 's sorry .
i would have do it for three .
not the stick chair . you look like an idiot on that thing .
uh , no , she 's still pretty mad .
oh , well , that 's lay it on a little thick .
you think it 's time you apologize to her yourself ?
i 'm happy to hold your place till you get back .
consider it my way of get more of your money .
that 's interest . i just attend a lecture on pediatric anxiety .
well , let 's get back to penny . hey , be n't you tell me something great about your company car ?
um , it have seat warmer .
amy . amy . amy .
oh , thanks , you 're a peach . beverly , we 'll catch up soon . bernadette , it be a pleasure a always , penny , you have spinach in your teeth .
since the airport , dear .
you look like you come with a kickstand .
you ca n't make me feel bad .
hmm , maybe not . leonard ?
so , when the alien brought you back , they just left the probe in ?
i 'm back .
anyone else need anything before i go ?
that 's mean .
you look like tigger if tigger look like a jackass .
do you see that ? he just cut the line .
he 's just join his friend . it 's fine .
we 're near the front of the line . we 'll get in either way .
what if every person in front of u let someone cut ?
we 'd still get in .
what if each of those people let someone cut ?
still get in .
but then each of those people let someone cut ?
we 'd still get in , but first i 'd hit you over the head with his stick chair .
excuse me .
oh , please do n't .
no .
uh , who make you line monitor ?
be this guy for real ?
that be very nice of sheldon to apologize .
your relationship with him be fascinate . i 'm prepare to write a book on high-achieving couple , and i would love to interview the both of you .
about what ?
well , be you seek a connection or just some form of validation ?
well , it 's not a clinical term . but one example would be your marry my son , and not invite me or even tell me the wedding be take place .
okay , good example .
the avenger be rule-breakers . be vengeful be in their job description .
a a matter of fact i do . at a little place call the dmv .
he 's get him there . the d even stand for department .
told you .
well , what a sad state of affair . that you 've all be so ground down by life , you do n't even notice when someone disrespect you .
why should we listen to you ? you cut the line yourself .
buddy , let it go .
no , i ca n't . this be n't right .
you do everything you could .
no , i could 've do more .
i 'm still human , penny . not get invite to my own son 's wedding be difficult to ignore .
i know how you feel . she do n't invite any of u .
i could 've watch it on the internet ?
no , i would 've say you 're make a huge mistake . but an invitation would 've be nice .
at the time i do . but i 've never see leonard so happy , so perhaps i be wrong .
i would find that perfectly acceptable .
hey .
hi , how be the screen ?
oh , sheldon invoked rosa park to make somebody who cut the line feel bad , but only the white people felt bad .
how 'd it go with my mother ?
uh , you know , it start a little rocky , but i think we get to a good place .
wow . well do .
yeah , and when i drop her off at the hotel , she even give me a hug .
do she think you be choke or i 'm sorry , that 's great . thank you for spending time with her .
wait , we 're gon na get married again ?
yeah , kind of , but now we can invite our friend and family .
seem like a lot of trouble for a hug .
come on , it 'll be fun , and , you know , your mom be genuinely hurt we do n't invite her to the first one .
look , in our defence , it be kind of a spur of the moment thing , and also , we do n't like her .
leonard , come on , she 's your mom . if we can do something to make her happy , why would n't we ?
i just say why , we do n't like her .
hey , look , then forget about her , let 's do it for u . we could keep it small and informal . this time we can invite our family .
thanks to overcrowd , yeah .
i 'd love it if my dad could come .
oh , you have to invite him . i have n't see him since the divorce .
oh , he 's like a different man . he stop twitch , and i think he grow an inch and a half .
well , then it 's settle . yay . so funny . i never thought my second marriage would be to you .
okay , so it 's not a legal ceremony , it 's just a chance for u to redo our vow so everyone can be part of it .
so there 's no maid of honour ?
no .
huh . but if i be to , say , wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you , you would n't be able to stop me , right ?
i do n't see how i could .
who 's go to officiate ?
i be kind of hop you would .
wait , now i 'm just some lousy maid of honour ?
hey , good news , i just get off the phone with my mother . she be come to the wedding .
who 's erno rubik ?
seriously ? he invent the rubik 's cube .
well , it 's very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for leonard 's mother .
how dare you invite your father without consult me .
you do understand our marriage end because he have an affair .
i be wrong , there 's three excuse for that .
you sure ?
look . the system be maintain it own stability , the quantum vortex apparatus be now control the orientation .

be you do with this nonsense ?
it 's not nonsense . this be how the u.s military work .
oh , if it 's even the u.s military . it could be foreign military pretend to be american .
you 're right . we turn our guidance system over to them , next thing we know , they 're use it against u .
penny , i hope the example of my fail marriage to leonard 's father do n't discourage you from the commitment you 've make to one another .
although alfred and i have a lot more go for u than you two .
my goodness , so all the way back to the flood .
do n't laugh , she be n't joking .
well , he come close . turn her into a giant block of ice .

actually , the joke be on her . i could still see the tv through the slat .
bet she 'd still tell her if she get married .
you 're not gon na let this go , be you ?
well , it 's kind of sad that they do n't know . i mean , they love leonard .
it 's understandable . amy be afraid to tell her mom she broke up with sheldon .
yeah ? how do it go ? do she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer ?
uh , well , actually , to be honest , i have n't told her yet .
you 've be give me a hard time and you have n't even told your mom about sheldon ?
i 'm feel a little dizzy from all the blood loss . i do n't know what you 're talk about .

well , what be it ?
you know that rototiller i get for the tractor ?
no .
oh , you should see it . it be a beautiful piece of machinery . anyway , uh , i back over your pet pig with it .
moondance ?
yeah , he 's , uh , not dance anymore .

you do n't tell me for a year ?
okay , amy , your turn .
it 's call lamaze breathing . it help you push .
great . he 's push with his uterus .
there 's get to be a smarter way of remove it .
yeah , this be nothing more than a physic problem .
right . archimedes once say give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it , and i shall move the world .
of course . all we need be to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this .
exactly . i 'll bet there 's something around here that could be a lever .
we 're gon na be here foreever .
the breakfast meat family ?
it 's not funny . you 're up . call your mother .
oh , maybe later . your pig die make me sad . and a little hungry .
okay . okay . fine . hi , mom .
i do n't think the lever 's work .
what make you say that ?
there 's get ta be something else we could try .
if this be star trek , we could use a phaser to blast it off .
no , it 's too broad of a beam . you 'd need something more precise , like superman 's heat vision .
ooh , the green lantern 's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it .
if you need a green hand , why not just use the hulk ?
oh , please , the hulk would never get across the border with that temper .
guy , excuse me , not that call one of the avenger be n't a perfectly reasonable choice , but we 're scientist . do n't you think we can figure this out use actual science ?
yes , we could use science . but it 's your bachelor party . lighten up .
we will , we will percussive shock you .
i have no idea tortilla chip be such a good fuel source .
they 're basically pure hydrocarbon soak in fat . let 's hope the lug nut expands .
what if that burning food attracts animal ?
we have plenty of food for the animal .
we do ?
that 's not very nice .
what be that awful smell ?
it 's burning salsa . i 'm hop the acidity and salinity combine with electricity will corrode the lug nut off .
what an innovative solution . perhaps i do n't give your mit education enough credit .
yeah , i saw it on mythbusters .
all right , this rust , combine with the aluminium recover from the van , be now thermite .
great . couple of pinch ought to do the trick .
be that enough to melt the lug nut ?
well , let 's start small . we can always add more .
you put up a good fight , lug nut , but you 've met your match .
hey , look , the lug nut 's off .
what ? what be you do back ?
we get a flat and could n't get the tyre off .
oh , i 'm sorry .
thank you .
if it make you feel any well , i pierce amy 's ear and her mom make her sit in my closet .

of course .
so , i 'm your seventh choice .
how can i help you ?
well , why do n't you look at this a an opportunity ? you have other roommate before leonard . maybe this be a chance to find someone new .
hey . you know who would be the perfect roomie ?
no i wo n't .
have you see this archie comic ? it 's actually archie versus predator .
how could archie defeat predator ?
hey .
do you guy know any musician ?
i be think it might be cool to have live music here a few night a week . you know , give this place more of a stay in business vibe .
i like all kind of music , but my favourite genre be free .
well , it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing .
what 's that ?
i like it . it sound exactly like something i should n't be expect to pay for .
dude , if we do this , we 're gon na need a cool band name .
you know , i 've actually have one i 've be sit on for year .

i 'm not gon na be your roommate , sheldon .
but i met with _ people , and they all walk out . and that hollywood phoney chris pratt never tweet me back .
i do n't know how to help you . you know , feeling be a part of life .
they do n't use to be . you and leonard and penny , you all poison me with emotion . i be like the tin man , perfectly content until that evil wizard give him a heart .
i do n't think that be the point of the movie .
fine , then i be like pinocchio before that jerk geppetto go and make him a real boy .
there you go .
so , what be you think for dinner ?
well , it 's thai food night .
well , honey , you do n't live with sheldon any more . you can have anything you want .

how about thai food ?
oh , thank god .
you heard him , no .
be you do okay ?
i guess . i 'm just , you know , worried about sheldon .
i hope so .
what else can you do ? move back in with him ?
i do like that he have the weather on it .

i ca n't believe sheldon ask you to be his roommate .

i do n't say that . i , i just like music you can dance to .
you can dance to this . um , uh , uh , thor and dr jones . thor and dr jones . one play with lightning , the other play with bone .
who care ? i thought the whole point of footprint on the moon be to write song that make people think .
where 's this come from ? a few hour ago , we both love this song .
i still love it . i just think there 's room for improvement .
you played it for emily , do n't you ?

oh , please . your brain belongs to whoever 's willing to sleep with you .
that be so not true .
really ? remember when you be gon na get circumcise for rachel bernstein ?

with pleasure .
what take you so long ?
buddy , i know me move in with penny feel like a big change , but it 's not .

but mostly here .

be that the prototype drive system for the high-g rover ?
no , bernadette get me a fitbit so she can track how much i 'm exercise .
that 'll teach her to care about your health .
when be the last actual exercise you get ?
the other day , when she try to put that fitbit on me and i ran away from her .
accord to a recent study , simply think about exercise , even while sit still , can have physical benefit . for all you know , i could be exercise right now .
be you ?
nah , i 'll do it tomorrow .
it would n't be the bad thing if we be more active .
you make an excellent point . ooh , i think i 'm get a runner 's high .
look at all these activity the university have . rock climb club , archery , flag football .
have me at flag , lose me at football .
yeah , i think it 's great you guy want to get more exercise , but do you really think sport be the right choice for you ?
what be you say ? we 're not coordinate enough to play sport ?
interest . sword fight do hold a certain elegant appeal . and i would imagine it meet many of our personal criterion for a sport .
it 's indoors , so no sunscreen .
or bad , up .
preach .
and a an add bonus , the word touche come from fence . it would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense .
well , i know more woman be buying comic than ever , but for some reason , i , i ca n't get 'em in here .
well , you do n't know the backstory . maybe she kept jumping up on the couch .
i feel cool . like pus in boot .
i always want to be a swashbuckler when i be a kid .
we can still be swashers .
that 's not why we 're here .
yeah , i 'm here because i think it 's gon na be like game of throne .
and maybe a little princess bride .
well , sowwy to disappoint you , but fence be a sewious spowt . if you 're not wiwwing to put in the effowt , you might a well just weave now .
we 're not afraid of physical activity .
what 's wong , cooper ?
well , i 'm not sure i have a dominant leg . they 're both pretty submissive .
when you 're in a public restroom , which foot do you flush the toilet with ?
right . always right .
okay , show me en garde . good . knee bent , swightwy over the toe . non-sword hand up for bawance .
good . the next move be call a wetweat . step back . back foot first , toe to heel . fwont foot fowwows . on thwee .

with your foil extend , kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg . now you twy . and again . and again .
look at u . we 're like the rockettes .
en garde , leonard . prepare yourself for a rigorous touch .
my name be inigo montoya . you kill my father . prepare to die .
my name be inigo montoya . you kill my father . prepare to die .
i thought you be pus in boot .
oh , yeah , right . sorry . my name be pus in boot . you kill my father . prepare to die .

ah , this be fun .
what 's go on with amy ?
good to know ? what 's that suppose to mean ?
oh . i hate to say it , but it sound like he 's interested in her .
well , that 's unacceptable .
oh , buddy , i get that you do n't like it , but it 's not really up to you .
yeah , but he 's dumb , and his face be dumb .
look , even if it 's not him , amy 's probably go to date someone at some point .
you really think so ?
of course . she deserves to be happy .
how dare you .
listen , i should warn you that maybe ask amy out be n't a good idea .
barry , a word ?
and now the crazy version of what i just say .
and how be you gon na do that ?
all right , i 'm not say it 's true , but let 's , let 's consider for a moment that possibly i 'm the problem .
okay , fine . what , i mean , what can i do ? i get so nervous around woman .
well , that 's 'cause i 'm do that trick where you imagine the audience be naked . by the way , thumb up , lady .
no , i 'm still do it .
okay , we 're all feel it . yes , i 'll go out with you .
suddenly , the rabbit thing make sense .
i 'm surprised you want to go to a sport bar , sheldon .
look at this blister . like it or not , we 're athlete now . besides , a bar be where i belong . i 'm have female problem .
if you 're cranky and retain water , i have a theory .
sheldon , instead of focus on amy date other guy , maybe you should start think about date another girl .
why ? you never thought you 'd end up in a relationship , and then you met amy . maybe there 's someone else out there for you .
true , but penny 's married , and so be bernadette . and your girlfriend have red hair and white skin , which really rub up against my clown phobia .
maybe you should consider woman who be n't in serious relationship with your closest friend ?
whoa , whoa . walk up to a strange woman in a bar usually do n't work .
you 're forget something . lady love jock .
how many sip of that beer do he have ?
three .
oh , boy .
what ?
i do n't know what that mean .
i 'm married , and i 'm her grandmother .
stuart take that rejection like a pro .
well , he knew he be on the breast cam .
oh , you get use to it . some guy you have to turn down over and over .
and sometimes we marry them anyway .
huh . well , this be weird .
what ?
oh . look at you , two guy in one day .
what do he say ?
hi , how be you ? i be wonder if you 'd like to get a drink after work sometime .
well , what be you gon na do ?
what can it hurt ?
you mean , not a scientist ?
be you attract to him ?
i do n't know .
all right , well , what happens if you imagine him naked ?
oh , i do n't have to imagine it .
i smell funny . i taste salty .
you 're just sweaty from exercise .
and kind of delicious . i wonder how many lick it would take to get to the centre of me .
i know it only take one doctor 's finger .
hello .
hello .
you do n't have to leave .
walk .
how have you be ?
i 'm do all right . i try fence today .
how 'd that go ?
it be pretty easy . and i think my background in mathletics help . barry kripke be there . i should let you know that he express interest in ask you out .
well , actually , he , he already do .
okay . but do n't get too attach to him . in two year , _ day , he 's a dead man .
i say no .
interest . i ask two woman out today , and they both say no .
i do n't know you be interested in date .
i 've be told it 's a good way to move on .
oh . okay . anyway , um , it 's nice to see you . you look good .
howie ?
leonard , i 've get terrible news .
what 's go on ?
before i tell you , perhaps i should soften the blow . you 're face be pleasingly symmetrical .
just tell me .
a swedish team of physicist be try to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment .
that kind of stink ? why be n't you more upset ? do i soften the blow too much ? because this here be more like a picasso painting .
what be we go to do ?
perform the experiment immediately .
i 'd love to , but we need liquid helium and our shipment 's on back order for a month .
a month ? what ? be you kid me ? that would have be a good time for you to soften the blow .
that shirt brings out the blue in your eye .
thank you . be n't you sweet .
let 's go check to see if the university have any helium in reserve .
sowwy , there 's a showtage . and what we do have i need for my quantum excitation study .
twue , but if it 's successful , i 'm have a pawty with bawwoons .
be honest , if the shoe be on the other foot , would you do this for me ?
not a chance .
what be you do ?
hell no .
he could 've soften the blow .
why do you need kripke ? ca n't you just go to party city for helium ?
sound like you on cinco de mayo .
hey , people be still talk about that party on siete de mayo .
leonard , if that swedish team beat u , i will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again . which be a shame , because swedish meatball be my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball .
who be he ?
where do he work ?
how do he get the helium ?
how many question be too many question ?
maybe he 's not for you .
hey , you know who go out on a date the other night ? stuart .

the man restock the cereal shelf .
he hand you the box directly and call you stretch .
it 's like it be yesterday .
do you want liquid helium or not ?
of course i do . i do n't want that swedish team scoop u .
then i 'm go to tell him we 're in .
be she help him with his research ?
sure . so , be we do this ?
remember ? do n't ask too many question ?
uh , but this be violate university code .
a little , but if i may quote einstein , the pursuit of science call u to ignore the rule set by man .
huh . all right , do it . tell him we 're in .
do .
i ca n't find that quote on the internet . do you make that up ?
before i answer , may i just say your skin have never look well .
be n't you just make of sugar .
i 'm not sure how i feel about this .
one of which would 've end in sex have she not say no . okay , all set .

hmm . could be , could be . go on .
okay , but now there 's this swedish team that read our paper and they 're try to beat u to our own discovery . we really need this helium .
okay . it 's a shame about those scientist rip you off . i expect a high ethical standard from our friend in sweden .
well , for the right amount of money , if you know where they live , there 's , uh , plenty we could do about it .
okay , here we go . now everyone can see . all right . where do we stand on cross-eyed mike ?
you know he wo n't be look at other girl .
unless they 're sit on the end of his nose .
ew , check out his tiny teeth . he look like a man-dolphin .

that 's a fair point . we would n't make fun of someone like this to their face .
look , it 's stuart .
you may want to leave the room .
will you stop with that already ?
i 'm try not to attract attention .
and tip his hat to the cleaning lady do n't do that ?
she say buenas noches . what be he suppose to do ?
let 's just start the experiment .
leonard , we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught .
the dealer do n't care , kripke have no authority over u , and you be related to a metal container would explain a lot . help me hook this up .
uh-oh .
what ?
what be it ?
it 's partially torn off , but the segment that remains read property of and the letter u .
it 's probably usc or ucla .
yeah , but what if it 's property of u.s government ? there 's a national helium reserve in amarillo , texas . if this be steal from there , we 're accessory to a federal crime .
let 's not jump to conclusion . a lot of thing start with u .
that 's true . there 's the u.s air force , u.s department of defence , u.s navy , you and i be go to jail .
listen , we can do the experiment a plan and beat the swedish team to the punch , or we can kiss our dream good-bye because we be to afraid to break a few rule .
ma'am .
okay , do everyone remember the rule ? if he 's shirtless , one sip . pose with a pet , two sip . pet and shirtless , chug like it 's your job . and pull .

be you tell the truth ?
nirsh .

i told my dad that you be the one who do n't want kid because i do n't want to disappoint him .
why be you still here ?
fine , i 'll leave . but it sound like somebody need a fresh diaper .
why ?
okay , i 'll think about it .
i know you would .
well now instead of idolize fictional character , you can focus on the real people who be already in your life .
those be very wise word .
they 'd just be so much more comfort if they come out of a television .
i think it 's so adorable you 're make sheldon breakfast .
well , he 's have a rough time . amy broke his heart , the dvr cut off the last minute of doctor who . that crow follow him home .
be n't you worried you 're make french toast on oatmeal day ?
ah , well , what 's this ? a pot of oatmeal ? or , thanks to you , what i will now call gloatmeal .
oh , i do n't want credit for that .
you 're in a good mood .
yeah , i be indeed . i have decide , instead of wallow in sadness about amy , it be time that i find myself a new female companion .
oh . good for you .
what brought this on ?
i realize something . when amy be in my life , i be hyper-focused on my work and ignore her .
and you do n't want to make the same mistake with the next woman .
no , i need a new woman in my life to ignore so i can hyper-focus on my work again .
hey , i make french toast stick .
on oatmeal day ?
ah , i also make oatmeal .
ooh , that 's a lot of carbohydrate for a man on the prowl . you know what ? you eat it . you 're married , it do n't matter what you look like .
do n't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow .
thank you for come by , gentleman .
no problem .
so what 's up ?
well , it be the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me . now that i 'm look for my next girlfriend , it seem only logical that i employ your service once again .
oh , no , it 's all right . i think of my time with amy a a stick of fruit stripe gum . sweet and enjoyable at first , but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness .
you 're not wrong about fruit stripe . i be always a hubba bubba man .
hey , the jaw want what it want .
gentleman .
oh , right , uh , girlfriend . okay .
be n't that a little unreasonable ?
all right , fine , she do n't need her own point of view . now , chop-chop .
come on , amy , show u the dress .
yeah , it 's your third date , maybe you could go more sexy .
well , some people think the sexiest organ be the brain .
no one ever bought me drink at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt .
do you have any heel high than this ? he 's pretty tall .
ooh , tall . finally some detail about this mystery man .

hey , you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy ?
i 'll just call the restaurant , pretend i 'm amy and check the reservation .
yeah , but i 'm little , so it 's adorable .
i think the quick way to find you a new girlfriend be just to get you on every date web site out there .
be you sure ? i 've heard that on those site , often when you think you 're correspond with someone , it 's actually a computer program pretend to be a real person .
and you 're afraid it 'll do a well job than you ?
excuse me . no one do a well job pretend to be a person than i do . siri come close , but i know more joke .
you seriously think woman would fight for you ?
people compete for job and trophy , why not me ?
he 's right , he know a lot of joke .
yeah , no , but it be basic human nature . if we present him a a prize , maybe they would .
well , he 's smart , he 's a respect scientist .
i do n't know if i 'd say you oh .
oh , we 'll make the puzzle extremely challenge to eliminate unworthy candidate .
oh , we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle give the winner sheldon 's contact information .
well , this be actually an interest social experiment .
i 'm a little jealous of the people who get to do it .
me , too . and we 've see the prize .
i do n't understand why we 're leave so early for the movie .
oh , i forgot to tell you , we 're gon na meet up with bernadette to spy on amy and her date .
what ? i do n't want to do that .
what , and you think i want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycle ?
this be the movie that big soda do n't want you to see .
no , it 's the movie your wife do n't want you to see .
so you 're actually okay with invade your friend 's privacy ?
you 're not curious who she 's out with ?
not really .
but you 're curious about aluminium can ? you 're a weird little guy .
that 's it . the sheldon cooper girlfriend challenge be officially live .
congratulation .
this be excite .
right now , somewhere , a woman be divide the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colour in the old national flag still in use .
then use that number a the average speed to calculate the travel time from mordor to the shire .
and , take her first step towards a lifetime of laughter , love and , best of all , rule .
i , i hope we do n't make the puzzle too hard .
well , if she can solve them , it 'll prove she 's intelligent , tenacious and so socially awkward she have nothing well to do on a saturday night .
this be fun . i have n't date much since my divorce .
oh , you know how it be , we want different thing . i want child , and she want a pastry chef name jean-philippe .
no , it 's , it 's fine . it 's why i left england . it remind me too much of her . cold , gloomy and easily access by a frenchman through a tunnel .

it 's more of a four-part question , really . when he write his paper on supersingular prime number , how long do it take ?
wow . i mean , wow . and you be there to see it ?
mm . i doubt it be like this one . i mean , he 's a genius , and i be n't even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smell of croissant .
